## 1. Overview of the VM
The VM executes plans consisting of a sequence of instructions. Each instruction performs a specific operation and may interact with variables stored in a variable store. The VM supports conditional execution and can handle dependencies between instructions through variable assignments and references.

### Key features:
- **Variable Store**: A key-value store where variables are stored and accessed by name.
- **Instruction Execution**: Instructions are executed sequentially unless control flow is altered by conditional statements.

## 2. Instruction Format
Each instruction in the plan is represented as a JSON object with the following keys:

- `seq_no`: A unique and AUTO-INCREMENT integer identifying the instruction's sequence within the plan, starting from 0.
- `type`: A string indicating the instruction type.
- `parameters`: An object containing parameters required by the instruction.
- `execution_objective`: A string that includes the purpose of the instruction, a detailed description of the expected output, and how this output will be used by subsequent instructions.

```json
{
  "seq_no": 0,
  "type": "instruction_type",
  "parameters": {
    "param1": "value_or_variable_reference",
    "param2": "value_or_variable_reference"
  },
  "execution_objective": "Description of the purpose, expected output, and usage in subsequent steps."
}
```

## 3. Supported Instructions
### 3.1 assign
- **Purpose**: Assigns values to one or more variables.
- **Parameters**: An object where each key is a variable name and each value is either a direct value or a variable reference.
- **Execution Objective**: Should include the purpose of the assignment, the expected values to be stored, and how these variables will be used in subsequent instructions.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "seq_no": 0,
  "type": "assign",
  "parameters": {
    "number": 42,
    "doubled_number": "${number}"
  },
  "execution_objective": "Assign the value 42 to 'number' and set 'doubled_number' to the value of 'number'. These variables will be used in calculations in subsequent steps."
}
```

### 3.2 jmp
- **Purpose**: Jumps to a specified sequence number based on an optional condition.
- **Parameters**:
  - `condition_prompt` (optional): The prompt to evaluate the condition. If provided, the LLM evaluates whether to jump. Must respond with a JSON object in the following format:
    ```json
    {
      "result": boolean,
      "explanation": string
    }
    ```
  - `context` (optional): Additional context for the LLM. Can be a direct string or a variable reference.
  - `jump_if_true`: The `seq_no` to jump to if the condition evaluates to true. Required if `condition_prompt` is provided.
  - `jump_if_false` (optional): The `seq_no` to jump to if the condition evaluates to false. Required if `condition_prompt` is provided.
  - `target_seq` (optional): The `seq_no` to jump to if no condition is provided (unconditional jump).
- **Execution Objective**: Should describe the purpose of the jump, the expected outcome of the condition evaluation, and how the result will affect subsequent execution flow.

**Example (Conditional Jump):**
```json
{
  "seq_no": 4,
  "type": "jmp",
  "parameters": {
    "condition_prompt": "Is ${number} even? Respond with a JSON object in the following format:\n{\n  \"result\": boolean,\n  \"explanation\": string\n}\nWhere 'result' is true if the number is even, false otherwise, and 'explanation' provides a brief reason for the result.",
    "context": null,
    "jump_if_true": 5,
    "jump_if_false": 6
  },
  "execution_objective": "Evaluate whether 'number' is even. If true, jump to step 5 to perform operations for even numbers; if false, jump to step 6 for odd number operations."
}
```

### 3.3 calling
- **Purpose**: Invokes a specific tool or function with the provided parameters.
- **Parameters**: Defines the specifications required to call a tool.
  - `tool`: The name of the tool to be called (e.g., "llm_generate", "retrieve_knowledge_graph", "vector_search").
  - `params`: An object containing key-value pairs that represent the arguments required by the specified tool.
    - Keys: Must match the argument names expected by the tool.
    - Values: Can be either a direct value or a variable reference.
  - `output_vars` (optional): Specifies how the output from the tool should be stored in the VMâ€™s variable store for later use. The type of output_vars can either be a string or an array.
    - If it is a string: The entire tool's response (whether text or JSON) will be stored under the specified variable name.
    - If it is an array: It specifies that the tool's response must be a valid JSON object and contain specific keys. Each entry in the array corresponds to a key in the JSON response, and the value associated with each key will be extracted and stored as a variable.
- **Execution Objective**: Should include the purpose of invoking the tool, a detailed description of the expected output, and how this output will be used in subsequent instructions.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "seq_no": 1,
  "type": "calling",
  "parameters": {
    "tool": "llm_generate",
    "params": {
      "prompt": "Analyze the sales data and provide summary and insights.",
      "context": "${sales_data}",
      "response_format": "json"
    },
    "output_vars": ["summary", "insights"]
  },
  "execution_objective": "Use the 'llm_generate' tool to analyze 'sales_data' and generate a summary and insights in JSON format. Store 'summary' and 'insights' for use in generating the final report in subsequent steps."
}
```

### 3.4 reasoning
- **Purpose**: Provides a detailed explanation of the plan's reasoning process, analysis, and steps.
- **Parameters**:
  - `chain_of_thoughts`: A string containing a comprehensive breakdown of the reasoning process.
  - `dependency_analysis`: A string or structured data describing the dependencies between different steps or sub-queries in the plan.
- **Execution Objective**: Not typically required for the 'reasoning' instruction, as it is a meta-commentary on the plan itself.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "seq_no": 0,
  "type": "reasoning",
  "parameters": {
    "chain_of_thoughts": "To provide best practices for optimizing TiDB performance for a high-volume e-commerce application, we're adopting a multi-step approach: ...",
    "dependency_analysis": "Step 2 depends on Step 1. ..."
  }
  // No execution_objective needed for 'reasoning' type
}
```

## 4. Parameters and Variable References
Parameters can be either direct values or variable references. To reference a variable, use the format `${variable_name}`.

**Direct Value Example:**
```json
"prompt": "What is the capital of France?"
```

**Variable Reference Example:**
```json
"prompt": "${user_question}"
```

## 5. Variables and Dependencies
- **Variable Assignment**: Use the `assign` instruction or specify an `output_vars` in a `calling` instruction that produces outputs.
- **Variable Access**: Reference variables in parameters using the variable reference format.
- **Dependencies**: Manage dependencies by assigning outputs to variables and referencing them in subsequent instructions. Use the `execution_objective` field to describe how outputs will be used in later steps.

## 6. Plan Structure
- **Sequential Execution**: Instructions are executed in order based on their `seq_no`.
- **Control Flow**: Use the `jmp` instruction for branching logic and conditional loops.

## 7. Best Practices
- **Sequence Numbering**: Ensure that `seq_no` values are unique and sequential within the plan.
- **Variable Naming**: Use descriptive variable names to make the plan readable and maintainable.
- **Control Flow**: Use `jmp` instructions to create conditional logic, manage execution flow, and implement loops effectively.
- **Final answer**: The name of output var of The last instruction MUST be "final_answer".
- **Instruction selection**: DO NOT USE other instruction type that not list above.
