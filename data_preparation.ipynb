Let me start by understanding the current plan and the goal.\\n\\nThe goal is to analyze how TiDB handles case sensitivity in schema names when querying the `information_schema.columns` table, comparing versions 6.5 and 5.1. The current plan uses `retrieve_knowledge_graph` and `vector_search` to gather information about case sensitivity in general for both versions. Then it uses `llm_generate` to compare and synthesize the results.\\n\\nThe user's suggestion is to make the plan more specific. They recommend adding vector_search steps that target the `information_schema.columns` table directly. This way, the retrieved information will be more relevant to the specific query behavior the user is interested in.\\n\\nSo, I need to modify the plan to include these more targeted vector_search queries. That means adding two new steps after the initial vector_search calls. These new steps will search for case sensitivity in the `information_schema.columns` table for both versions.\\n\\nNext, the `llm_generate` step needs to be updated to include these new variables. The prompt should explicitly ask about the behavior when querying `information_schema.columns`, highlighting any differences between the versions.\\n\\nI also need to make sure that the output variables are correctly assigned and referenced. The new vector_search steps will add `tidb_6_5_info_schema` and `tidb_5_1_info_schema` variables. These will be included in the `llm_generate` context to ensure the comparison is comprehensive.\\n\\nFinally, the `final_answer` should incorporate the updated comparison result, ensuring that the final output directly addresses the specific behavior in the `information_schema.columns` table.\\n\\nI should also check that all steps are correctly ordered and that dependencies are maintained. The new steps should come after the initial vector_search calls but before the `llm_generate` step.\\n\\nLet me outline the changes:\\n\\n1. Add two new `calling` steps after step 4, using `vector_search` with queries targeting `information_schema.columns` for both versions.\\n2.

In TiDB 6.5, the default behavior for case sensitivity in TiCDC Changefeed configuration has been altered. The `case-sensitive` parameter, which determines whether database and table names are case-sensitive, has its default value changed from `true` to `false`. This means that by default, table and database names are now case-insensitive in TiCDC configurations starting from versions v6.5.6, v7.1.3, and v7.5.0. This change affects configurations related to filters and sinks, making it easier to manage schema names without worrying about case differences. For more details, you can refer to the [TiDB 7.1.3 Release Notes](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-7.1.3).\\n\\nIn contrast, TiDB 5.1 had a different approach to case sensitivity. The `case-sensitive` configuration option in Data Migration (DM) determined whether schema names were case-sensitive. This implies that in TiDB 5.1, case sensitivity was more rigidly enforced, and users needed to explicitly configure this setting to handle case differences in schema names.\\n\\nThe key difference between the two versions is the default behavior regarding case sensitivity. TiDB 6.5 has moved towards a more flexible, case-insensitive default setting, whereas TiDB 5.1 required explicit configuration to achieve similar behavior. This change in TiDB 6.5 simplifies the management of schema names, especially in environments where case consistency might not be strictly maintained.', 'reasoning': \"To achieve the goal of understanding how TiDB handles case sensitivity in schema names when querying the `information_schema.columns` table and how this behavior differs between TiDB versions 6.5 and 5.1, we need to follow a structured approach:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Context**: We need to gather information on how TiDB handles case sensitivity in schema names, specifically when querying the `information_schema.columns` table.

In TiDB 6.5, the `SHOW DATABASES LIKE` statement is case-insensitive by default, which means that schema names are compared without regard to case. This change was introduced in TiDB 6.1.1 and further refined in subsequent versions, including TiDB 6.2.0, which addressed specific case sensitivity bugs.\\n\\nIn contrast, TiDB 5.1 had issues with case sensitivity, where certain operations, such as `SHOW DATABASES LIKE`, were case-sensitive by default.

This means that if you query using a schema name with different casing than what is stored, the query might not return the expected results.\\n   - In TiDB 6.5, improvements have been made to handle case sensitivity more flexibly. The `SHOW DATABASES LIKE` statement, for instance, was made case-insensitive in version 6.1.1, indicating a trend towards more case-insensitive handling in later versions. This change suggests that TiDB 6.5 likely continues this approach, making schema name comparisons less sensitive to case by default.\\n\\n2. **Changes in Handling**:\\n   - The transition from TiDB 5.1 to 6.5 reflects a shift towards reducing case sensitivity issues, aligning more closely with user expectations and improving compatibility with MySQL, which is generally case-insensitive for schema names.\\n   - These changes are part of broader efforts to enhance usability and reduce errors related to case mismatches in SQL queries.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on these changes, you can refer to the TiDB documentation for version 6.1.1 and 6.2.0, which discuss the case sensitivity adjustments and other related improvements:\\n- [TiDB 6.1.1 Release Notes](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-6.1.1)\\n- [TiDB 6.2.0 Release Notes](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-6.2.0)', 'reasoning': \"Alright, let me walk through my thought process as I update the plan based on the user's suggestions and the current execution state.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the goal: comparing case sensitivity in schema names when querying `information_schema.columns` between TiDB versions 6.5 and 5.1.

This way, for each version, I can retrieve information about both case sensitivity and `information_schema.columns` in one step, reducing redundancy and improving efficiency.\\n\\nNext, I need to modify the vector_search queries to explicitly target the schema name case sensitivity as it applies to `information_schema.columns`.

The original plan involved using vector_search, retrieve_knowledge_graph, and llm_generate to gather information and provide recommendations.\\n\\nThe user\\'s suggestion was to explicitly map each current configuration value against best practices. For example, pointing out that the replica count of 2 is below the recommended odd count, which could cause split-brain issues. They also mentioned considering the lease value, log rotation, resource limits, and storage class parameters. Additionally, they suggested gathering performance data and referencing official documentation for tailored recommendations.\\n\\nNow, I need to analyze how to incorporate these suggestions into the plan.

Here is a comprehensive evaluation and specific recommendations for each parameter:\\n\\n1. **Annotations**\\n   - **Recommendation**: Implement annotations to provide metadata about the PD instance. This will enhance management and monitoring capabilities, making it easier to identify and manage PD instances in a large cluster.\\n\\n2. **Base Image**\\n   - **Recommendation**: Ensure that the latest stable version of the PD base image is used. This practice helps in maintaining security and performance by incorporating the latest patches and improvements.\\n\\n3. **Lease**\\n   - **Recommendation**: Configure lease settings to optimize leader election and failover processes. Proper lease settings can reduce failover times and prevent data inconsistency.\\n\\n4. **Log Level**\\n   - **Recommendation**: Set the log level to \"info\" for general operations and switch to \"debug\" when troubleshooting is necessary. This ensures that logs are informative without being overwhelming.\\n\\n5. **Log File**\\n   - **Recommendation**: Specify a log file path to ensure that logs are stored persistently. This is crucial for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.\\n\\n6. **Replication**\\n   - **Current Value**: Default is 3\\n   - **Recommendation**: Verify that the replication factor aligns with your cluster\\'s fault tolerance requirements. Adjust if necessary to prevent data loss during node failures.\\n\\n7. **Limits**\\n   - **Recommendation**: Set resource limits to prevent PD from consuming excessive resources, which could impact other components in the cluster.\\n\\n8. **Max Failover Count**\\n   - **Recommendation**: Configure a reasonable number of failovers to ensure high availability. This prevents unnecessary resource usage while maintaining uptime.\\n\\n9. **Node Selector**\\n   - **Recommendation**: Use node selectors to ensure PD instances are scheduled on appropriate nodes. This helps in optimizing performance and resource utilization.\\n\\n10. **Replicas**\\n    - **Recommendation**: Ensure there are at least 3 replicas for high availability. This setup helps in avoiding single points of failure.\\n\\n11. **Requests**\\n    - **Recommendation**: Set resource requests to guarantee that PD has the necessary resources to operate efficiently. This prevents performance degradation due to resource shortages.\\n\\n12. **Start Timeout**\\n    - **Recommendation**: Configure a reasonable start timeout to ensure PD starts within expected timeframes. This avoids unnecessary restarts and delays in recovery.\\n\\n13. **Storage Class Name**\\n    - **Recommendation**: Use a storage class that provides the required performance and reliability. This prevents performance bottlenecks related to storage.\\n\\n14. **Tolerations**\\n    - **Recommendation**: Set tolerations to allow PD to run on nodes with specific taints.

This parameter defines the maximum time a transaction will wait to acquire a lock before timing out. By setting it to 1 second, you are effectively reducing the time a transaction will wait for a lock, which can have several effects:\\n\\n1. **Reduced Wait Time**: Transactions will only wait for 1 second to acquire a lock. If the lock is not acquired within this time, the transaction will timeout, and an error code (1205) will be returned. This can help in quickly identifying and resolving lock contention issues, as transactions will not be stuck waiting indefinitely.\\n\\n2. **Increased Error Frequency**: With a shorter timeout, there is a higher likelihood of transactions failing due to lock timeouts, especially in environments with high contention. This can lead to an increase in error handling requirements within applications, as they need to manage these timeout errors more frequently.\\n\\n3. **Potential for Higher Throughput**: In some cases, reducing the lock wait timeout can lead to higher throughput, as transactions that cannot proceed due to lock contention are quickly terminated, allowing other transactions to proceed. This can be beneficial in systems where quick failure and retry are preferable to long waits.\\n\\n4. **Impact on Transaction Processing**: Transactions that involve multiple operations or that are part of complex workflows may experience more frequent interruptions due to lock timeouts. This can affect the overall transaction processing time and may require adjustments in transaction design or application logic to handle these scenarios effectively.\\n\\n5. **Effect on Query Execution**: Queries that require locks, such as those involving updates or deletes, may fail more often if they cannot acquire the necessary locks within the 1-second window. This can lead to increased query retries and may necessitate changes in query optimization or execution strategies.\\n\\nOverall, setting the `innodb_lock_wait_timeout` to a low value like 1 second can be a double-edged sword.

This parameter defines the maximum time a transaction will wait to acquire a lock before timing out. Here\\'s how it impacts various aspects of TiDB:\\n\\n### Impact on Query Execution and Transaction Processing\\n\\n1. **Lock Wait Timeout**: With `innodb_lock_wait_timeout` set to 1 second, transactions will only wait for a lock for up to 1 second before timing out. This is particularly relevant in scenarios where multiple transactions are competing for the same resources. If a transaction cannot acquire the necessary lock within this short timeframe, it will be aborted, and an error will be returned to the client.\\n\\n2. **Error Code 1205**: When a transaction exceeds the lock wait timeout, TiDB returns an error code `1205`, indicating \"Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction.\" This error suggests that the transaction was unable to acquire the lock within the specified timeout period and needs to be retried. This behavior is consistent with MySQL\\'s handling of lock wait timeouts.\\n\\n3. **Pessimistic Transaction Mode**: In the pessimistic transaction mode, transactions wait for locks held by other transactions. The `innodb_lock_wait_timeout` setting is crucial here, as it determines how long a transaction will wait before giving up. A 1-second timeout can lead to frequent transaction aborts in high-contention environments, necessitating careful application logic to handle retries and potential conflicts.\\n\\n4. **Transaction Throughput and Latency**: A shorter lock wait timeout can increase transaction throughput by quickly aborting transactions that are unable to acquire locks, thus freeing up resources for other transactions. However, it can also increase latency for individual transactions that frequently encounter lock contention, as they may need to be retried multiple times.\\n\\n### Examples and Documentation\\n\\n- **Example of Lock Wait Timeout**: The official documentation provides an example where a transaction is trying to acquire a pessimistic lock but is blocked by another transaction holding the lock. If the lock is not acquired within the timeout period, the transaction will be aborted, and an error will be returned. This scenario is detailed in the [TiDB documentation on lock conflicts](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/troubleshoot-lock-conflicts).\\n\\n- **Troubleshooting Lock Conflicts**: The documentation also offers guidance on troubleshooting lock conflicts, including using the `DATA_LOCK_WAITS` system table to identify keys that frequently cause lock contention. This can help in diagnosing and resolving issues related to lock wait timeouts. More details can be found in the [troubleshooting section](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/troubleshoot-lock-conflicts).\\n\\nBy setting the `innodb_lock_wait_timeout` to 1 second, you can effectively manage lock contention in TiDB, but it requires careful consideration of transaction design and error handling to ensure that applications can gracefully handle frequent retries and potential transaction aborts.', 'reasoning': 'Okay, I\\'m trying to figure out how to update the plan based on the suggestions provided.

This is particularly relevant in high-contention environments where multiple transactions might be competing for the same resources. The short timeout can lead to frequent transaction aborts if locks are not quickly available.\\n\\n2. **Error Code 1205**: When a transaction exceeds the lock wait timeout, TiDB returns an error code `1205`, indicating \"Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction.\" This error suggests that the transaction should be retried, as it was unable to acquire the necessary locks within the specified timeout period.\\n\\n3. **Pessimistic Transactions**: In TiDB, pessimistic transactions are designed to handle lock contention by waiting for locks to be released. However, with a 1-second timeout, the ability of these transactions to wait is severely limited, potentially leading to increased transaction aborts and retries. This can affect the overall throughput and latency of the system, especially if transactions frequently encounter lock contention.\\n\\n4. **Transaction Retries**: The short timeout may lead to more frequent transaction retries, as transactions that cannot acquire locks within 1 second will need to be retried. This can increase the load on the system and may require adjustments in application logic to handle retries more gracefully.\\n\\n### Examples and Documentation\\n\\n- **Locking Functions**: TiDB supports various user-level locking functions, and the `innodb_lock_wait_timeout` setting affects how these locks are managed. For instance, the `GET_LOCK` function will respect the timeout setting, and if a lock cannot be acquired within 1 second, it will fail [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/locking-functions).\\n\\n- **Troubleshooting Lock Conflicts**: The `DATA_LOCK_WAITS` system table can be used to monitor lock-waiting status and identify keys that frequently cause contention. This can help in diagnosing issues related to short lock wait timeouts [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/troubleshoot-lock-conflicts).\\n\\n- **Pessimistic Lock Conflicts**: In scenarios where the lock wait timeout is exceeded, the error message returned will be similar to: `ERROR 1205 (HY000): Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction`. This indicates that the transaction should be retried, and adjustments may be needed in the application logic to handle such cases [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/troubleshoot-lock-conflicts).\\n\\nIn summary, setting the `innodb_lock_wait_timeout` to 1 second in TiDB can lead to increased transaction aborts and retries, especially in environments with high lock contention. It is crucial to monitor the system\\'s behavior and adjust application logic to handle the potential increase in retries and error handling.

This parameter defines the maximum time a transaction will wait to acquire a lock before timing out. By reducing this timeout to 1 second, you are effectively minimizing the time transactions will wait for locks, which can lead to frequent transaction aborts if locks are not acquired quickly.\\n\\n### Impact on Query Execution and Transaction Processing\\n\\n1. **Frequent Transaction Aborts**: With a 1-second timeout, transactions that cannot acquire the necessary locks within this short period will be aborted. This is particularly impactful in scenarios where multiple transactions are competing for the same resources, leading to increased transaction rollbacks.\\n\\n2. **Read and Write Queries**: Both read and write queries can be affected. For write queries, if a lock cannot be acquired quickly, the transaction will be aborted, potentially leading to data inconsistency if not handled properly. For read queries, especially those using `SELECT FOR UPDATE`, the inability to acquire a lock will result in the query being terminated prematurely.\\n\\n3. **Need for Retry Logic**: Applications interacting with TiDB will need to implement robust retry logic to handle the increased likelihood of transaction aborts. This involves catching specific error codes and retrying the transaction, which can add complexity to application logic.\\n\\n4. **Performance Trade-offs**: While a shorter lock wait timeout can reduce the time transactions are blocked, it can also lead to higher transaction abort rates, which may degrade overall system performance. The trade-off involves balancing between reducing lock wait times and maintaining transaction success rates.\\n\\n### Error Codes and Real-World Scenarios\\n\\n- **Error Code 1205**: This MySQL-compatible error code is returned when a transaction times out while waiting for a lock. In a real-world scenario, if multiple transactions are trying to update the same row, and the lock cannot be acquired within 1 second, the transaction will be aborted with this error code.\\n\\n- **Error Code 3572**: This error code is associated with the `FOR UPDATE NOWAIT` syntax, which does not wait for locks to be released. Instead, it immediately returns an error if the lock cannot be acquired. This can be useful in scenarios where immediate feedback is preferred over waiting for locks.\\n\\n### Real-World Example\\n\\nConsider a high-traffic e-commerce application where multiple users are trying to update their shopping carts simultaneously. If the `innodb_lock_wait_timeout` is set to 1 second, transactions that cannot acquire the necessary locks on the cart items within this time will be aborted, leading to potential user frustration. The application must be designed to handle these aborts gracefully, possibly by retrying the transaction or informing the user to try again later.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on the `innodb_lock_wait_timeout` and its implications, you can refer to the official TiDB documentation: [TiDB Pessimistic Transaction Mode](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/pessimistic-transaction) and [TiDB 3.0.6 Release Notes](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-3.0.6).', 'reasoning': \"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to update the plan based on the user's suggestions.

Here's how this setting affects query execution and transaction processing:\\n\\n1. **Impact on Query Execution and Transaction Processing**:\\n   - **Lock Contention**: In scenarios where multiple transactions are competing for the same lock, setting a low `innodb_lock_wait_timeout` means that transactions will quickly timeout if they cannot acquire the lock within 1 second. This can lead to frequent transaction aborts, especially in high-concurrency environments.\\n   - **Read and Write Queries**: Both read and write queries that require locks will be affected. For instance, a `SELECT FOR UPDATE` statement that cannot acquire a lock within the specified timeout will fail, as will any `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `INSERT` operations that encounter lock contention.\\n\\n2. **Implications of Frequent Transaction Aborts**:\\n   - **Error Codes**: When a transaction times out due to lock contention, TiDB returns a MySQL-compatible error code `1205`, indicating a lock wait timeout. Additionally, if a `FOR UPDATE NOWAIT` query is executed, it will return error code `3572` if it cannot acquire the lock immediately.\\n   - **Retry Logic**: Applications interacting with TiDB need to implement retry logic to handle these frequent transaction aborts gracefully. This involves catching the timeout errors and retrying the transaction, which can add complexity to application code.\\n\\n3. **Performance Trade-offs**:\\n   - **Throughput vs. Latency**: While a lower timeout can reduce the time transactions spend waiting, potentially improving system responsiveness, it can also lead to increased transaction rollbacks, which might reduce overall throughput. This trade-off needs careful consideration based on the specific workload and concurrency levels.\\n\\n4. **Real-world Scenarios**:\\n   - **High-concurrency Applications**: In applications with many concurrent transactions, such as online transaction processing (OLTP) systems, setting a low lock wait timeout can lead to frequent rollbacks, requiring robust retry mechanisms.\\n   - **Batch Processing**: For batch processing tasks that involve large data modifications, a low timeout might cause frequent failures, necessitating adjustments in transaction handling strategies.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on how TiDB handles lock wait timeouts and transaction processing, you can refer to the official documentation on [TiDB Pessimistic Transaction Mode](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/pessimistic-transaction) and [Timeouts in TiDB](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/dev-guide-timeouts-in-tidb).\", 'reasoning': 'Alright, let\\'s break down how I arrived at the updated plan.

Here's a detailed solution to resolve these warnings:\\n\\n### Understanding the Configurations\\n\\n1. **Initial-Cluster Configuration**:\\n   - The `initial-cluster` configuration is crucial during the bootstrapping phase of a TiDB cluster. It defines the initial setup of PD (Placement Driver) nodes, specifying how they should communicate and establish the cluster's metadata management.\\n   - This configuration is used to prevent different clusters from inadvertently communicating with each other during the bootstrap process. It ensures that only the intended nodes are part of the initial cluster setup.\\n\\n2. **Join Configuration**:\\n   - The `join` configuration is used when adding new nodes to an existing cluster. It allows new nodes to join the cluster by connecting to existing nodes, ensuring they integrate correctly into the cluster's topology and metadata management.\\n\\n### Resolving Configuration Inconsistency Warnings\\n\\nTo resolve warnings related to these configurations, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Verify Configuration Consistency**:\\n   - Ensure that the `initial-cluster` configuration is correctly set on all PD nodes during the initial setup. This configuration should be identical across all nodes to prevent any inconsistencies.\\n   - Check that the `join` configuration is correctly specified for any new nodes being added to the cluster. The `join` parameter should point to the correct existing nodes in the cluster.\\n\\n2. **Check for Configuration Errors**:\\n   - Review the configuration files for any syntax errors or incorrect parameters. Ensure that all nodes have the correct IP addresses and ports specified.\\n   - Use tools like `pd-ctl` to verify the current cluster configuration and ensure that all nodes are correctly recognized by the cluster.\\n\\n3. **Restart and Reconfigure if Necessary**:\\n   - If inconsistencies are found, you may need to restart the PD nodes with the correct configurations. Note that some configuration changes, especially those related to `initial-cluster`, may require a restart to take effect.\\n   - For dynamic configuration changes, use tools like `TiUP` to modify settings without requiring a full restart, where applicable.\\n\\n4. **Monitor and Validate**:\\n   - After making changes, monitor the cluster to ensure that all nodes are functioning correctly and that there are no further warnings or errors.\\n   - Validate the cluster's health using monitoring tools and dashboards provided by TiDB, such as the TiDB Dashboard or Grafana.\\n\\n5. **Documentation and Best Practices**:\\n   - Document the configuration changes and ensure that all team members are aware of the correct setup procedures.\\n   - Follow best practices for cluster configuration, such as maintaining consistent configuration files across all nodes and regularly reviewing and updating configurations as needed.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can effectively resolve configuration inconsistency warnings related to `initial-cluster` and `join` configurations in a TiDB cluster, ensuring optimal performance and stability.\", 'reasoning': 'To address the configuration inconsistency warnings related to the `initial-cluster` and `join` configurations in a TiDB cluster, we need to follow a structured troubleshooting approach.

Here are some detailed steps and references to the official TiDB documentation:\\n\\n1. **Initial-Cluster Configuration**:\\n   - The `initial-cluster-token` configuration is crucial for preventing different clusters from communicating during the bootstrap process. This setting ensures that clusters do not accidentally join each other, which can lead to inconsistencies.\\n   - You can configure this setting in the PD configuration file. For more details, refer to the official documentation on configuring PD: [PD Configuration](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-4.0.6).\\n\\n2. **Join Inconsistencies**:\\n   - If you encounter join inconsistencies, such as incorrect results from join operations, it may be necessary to review and adjust the query execution plans or the underlying data distribution.\\n   - Ensure that the TiDB and TiKV nodes are properly synchronized and that the data distribution is balanced across the cluster. This can involve checking the status of the nodes and the health of the cluster using the TiDB Dashboard or other monitoring tools.\\n   - For specific bug fixes related to join operations, you can refer to the release notes of various TiDB versions. For example, the TiDB 5.0.3 release notes address issues with merge joins and other join-related bugs: [TiDB 5.0.3 Release Notes](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/release-5.0.3).\\n\\nBy following these guidelines and referring to the official documentation, you can effectively resolve initial-cluster and join inconsistencies in your TiDB deployment.\\nTo ensure that configuration adjustments have resolved inconsistency warnings, you can follow a structured set of verification steps. These steps include log checks, cluster monitoring, and validation tests. Here's a comprehensive guide:\\n\\n### 1. Pre-Verification Preparation\\n- **Document Changes**: Ensure all configuration changes are documented, including the rationale and expected outcomes.\\n- **Backup Configuration**: Before making changes, ensure you have a backup of the original configuration for rollback if necessary.\\n\\n### 2.

The user is experiencing configuration inconsistency warnings in their TiDB cluster, specifically related to the `initial-cluster` and `join` configurations for PD nodes. The goal is to resolve these warnings to ensure a stable cluster setup. \\n\\nFirst, I need to understand why these warnings are occurring. Configuration inconsistencies usually happen when the PD nodes don't have uniform settings, leading to conflicts during cluster operations. The `initial-cluster` configuration defines the initial set of PD nodes, while the `join` configuration allows new nodes to join the cluster. If these configurations are not correctly aligned, it can cause issues like nodes not joining properly or the cluster becoming unstable.\\n\\nThe current plan involves gathering information using `retrieve_knowledge_graph` and `vector_search`, then generating a solution with `llm_generate`. However, the suggestions indicate that adding diagnostic commands and verification steps would improve the plan. Specifically, using `pd-ctl` to check configurations and `tiup` for managing nodes could help diagnose and fix issues. Additionally, referencing official documentation and verifying that the changes resolve the warnings would add thoroughness.\\n\\nI'll start by incorporating diagnostic steps. Using `pd-ctl config show` can help inspect the current configuration of each PD node, ensuring they are consistent. If discrepancies are found, `tiup` can be used to reload configurations or restart nodes, which might resolve the issue. \\n\\nNext, I should reference the official TiDB documentation to ensure that the configurations are set correctly. This step provides a solid foundation for making accurate adjustments. \\n\\nAfter making the necessary changes, it's crucial to verify that the warnings have been resolved. This can be done by checking the logs or monitoring dashboards, which should show that the cluster is stable and free of configuration warnings.\\n\\nAnother consideration is potential version mismatches or token configurations. Ensuring all PD nodes are running the same version and that the `initial-cluster-token` is correctly set can prevent further inconsistencies.\\n\\nI'll update the plan to include these steps. After gathering information with `retrieve_knowledge_graph` and `vector_search`, I'll add a step to run diagnostic commands using `pd-ctl` and `tiup`. Then, I'll reference the official documentation and proceed to adjust configurations if necessary. Finally, I'll add a verification step to confirm that the warnings have been resolved.\\n\\nThis approach ensures that the plan is comprehensive, addressing both the symptoms and potential root causes of the configuration inconsistencies.

This guide provides a detailed step-by-step approach to diagnosing and resolving configuration inconsistencies.\\n\\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Resolve Configuration Inconsistencies\\n\\n#### Step 1: Verify PD Member List\\n1. **List Current PD Members:**\\n   - Use the `pd-ctl` tool to list all PD members in the cluster:\\n     ```bash\\n     pd-ctl member list\\n     ```\\n   - Ensure that all expected PD nodes are listed, and their statuses are active. This confirms that the nodes are recognized by the cluster.\\n\\n#### Step 2: Check PD Configuration Files\\n1. **Access Configuration Files:**\\n   - Locate the configuration file for each PD node, typically named `config.toml` or specified via the `--config` flag.\\n   - Open the configuration file and verify the following parameters:\\n     - **`name`:** Ensure each PD node has a unique name.\\n     - **`data-dir`:** Confirm that the data directory is correctly specified.\\n     - **`client-urls` and `advertise-client-urls`:** Verify these URLs are correctly set for client access.\\n     - **`peer-urls` and `advertise-peer-urls`:** Ensure these URLs are correctly set for peer communication.\\n\\n2. **Verify `initial-cluster` Configuration:**\\n   - Check the `initial-cluster` parameter in the configuration file. It should list all PD nodes with their respective `advertise-peer-urls`.\\n   - Example format:\\n     ```toml\\n     initial-cluster = \"pd1=http://192.168.100.113:2380, pd2=http://192.168.100.114:2380, pd3=http://192.168.100.115:2380\"\\n     ```\\n\\n3. **Verify `join` Configuration (if applicable):**\\n   - If a PD node is joining an existing cluster, ensure the `--join` flag is used with the correct `advertise-client-urls` of an existing PD node.\\n   - Example command:\\n     ```bash\\n     pd-server --join=\"http://192.168.100.113:2379\"\\n     ```\\n\\n#### Step 3: Validate Network Connectivity\\n1. **Check Connectivity Between PD Nodes:**\\n   - Use tools like `ping` or `telnet` to ensure that each PD node can reach the others via their `advertise-peer-urls`.\\n   - Example:\\n     ```bash\\n     ping 192.168.100.114\\n     telnet 192.168.100.114 2380\\n     ```\\n\\n#### Step 4: Review PD Logs\\n1. **Examine PD Logs for Errors or Warnings:**\\n   - Check the log files of each PD node for any errors or warnings that might indicate configuration issues.\\n   - Logs are typically found in the directory specified by the `--log-file` flag or in the default log location.\\n\\n#### Step 5: Use PD API for Additional Checks\\n1. **Access the PD API to Check Cluster Status:**\\n   - Use the PD API endpoint to get detailed information about the cluster.\\n   - Example API call to get cluster status:\\n     ```bash\\n     curl http://<pd-ip>:2379/pd/api/v1/cluster\\n     ```\\n   - Review the output for any discrepancies or issues.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that the `initial-cluster` and `join` configurations are correctly set and consistent across all PD nodes. This consistency is crucial for the stable operation of your TiDB cluster. Regularly verifying these configurations and monitoring PD logs will help prevent and quickly resolve any potential issues.', 'reasoning': 'Alright, so I need to update the plan based on the user\\'s suggestions.

This guide will help you verify the current configuration, identify discrepancies, and ensure consistency across all PD nodes.\\n\\n### Step-by-Step Solution\\n\\n#### 1. Verify Current PD Configuration\\nFirst, check the current configuration of your PD nodes to understand the existing setup.\\n\\n- **Use `pd-ctl` to show the configuration:**\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  pd-ctl config show\\n  ```\\n\\n  This command will display the current configuration settings, including `initial-cluster`, `join`, `initial-cluster-token`, and `force-new-cluster`.\\n\\n#### 2. Identify Configuration Discrepancies\\nCompare the configuration across all PD nodes to identify any inconsistencies.\\n\\n- **Check `initial-cluster`:** Ensure that the `initial-cluster` parameter lists all PD nodes with their correct URLs. This parameter should be consistent across all nodes.\\n\\n- **Check `join`:** If nodes are dynamically joining the cluster, verify that the `join` parameter is correctly set to the client URLs of existing PD nodes.\\n\\n- **Check `initial-cluster-token`:** Ensure that this token is unique to your cluster to prevent cross-cluster communication.\\n\\n- **Check `force-new-cluster`:** This should be set to `false` unless you are intentionally starting a new cluster.\\n\\n#### 3. Ensure Configuration Consistency\\nMake sure all PD nodes have consistent configurations. You can manually check the configuration files on each PD node or use `pd-ctl` to compare settings.\\n\\n- **Manual Check:** Access each PD node and review the configuration file (usually located in `/etc/pd/pd.toml` or a similar path).\\n\\n- **Automated Check:** Use a script to compare configurations across nodes and highlight differences.\\n\\n#### 4. Update Configuration if Necessary\\nIf you find discrepancies, update the configuration files to ensure consistency.\\n\\n- **Edit Configuration Files:** Modify the configuration files on each PD node to match the desired setup. Pay special attention to `initial-cluster` and `join` parameters.\\n\\n- **Restart PD Nodes:** After updating the configuration, restart the PD nodes to apply changes.\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  systemctl restart pd\\n  ```\\n\\n#### 5. Validate Configuration Changes\\nAfter making changes, validate that the configuration is consistent and the cluster is functioning correctly.\\n\\n- **Re-run `pd-ctl` Commands:**\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  pd-ctl member list\\n  pd-ctl config show\\n  ```\\n\\n  Ensure that all PD nodes are listed and active, and that the configuration matches the expected setup.\\n\\n#### 6. Check System Logs\\nReview the PD logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate configuration issues.\\n\\n- **Log Location:** Logs are typically located in the directory specified by the `--log-file` parameter or in the default log location.\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  tail -f /path/to/pd/log/file\\n  ```\\n\\n  Look for any discrepancies or errors related to cluster configuration or network issues.\\n\\n#### 7. Verify Network Connectivity\\nEnsure that all PD nodes can communicate with each other and with clients.\\n\\n- **Using `netstat`:** Check if the PD ports (default 2379 for client and 2380 for peer communication) are open and listening.\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  netstat -tuln | grep 2379\\n  netstat -tuln | grep 2380\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Using `curl`:** Test connectivity to the PD endpoints.\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  curl http://<pd-node-ip>:2379/pd/api/v1/cluster\\n  ```\\n\\n  This should return cluster information if the node is reachable.\\n\\n#### 8. Additional Checks\\n- **TLS Configuration:** If TLS is enabled, ensure that the `--cacert`, `--cert`, and `--key` parameters are correctly set and that certificates are valid.\\n\\n- **Metrics:** If using Prometheus, verify that the `--metrics-addr` is correctly configured to push metrics to the Prometheus Pushgateway.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can resolve configuration inconsistency warnings and ensure that your PD nodes are correctly configured, leading to a stable and well-functioning TiDB cluster. If you encounter any issues, the logs and network tests should provide insights into potential misconfigurations or connectivity problems.', 'reasoning': \"Alright, I need to update the plan based on the user's suggestions. Let me go through the problem step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the goal is to resolve configuration inconsistency warnings in a TiDB cluster, specifically related to the initial-cluster and join configurations for PD nodes. The user has provided some suggestions to improve the plan, such as adding specific PD diagnostic commands, gathering concrete examples, and incorporating error checking steps.\\n\\nLooking at the current plan, it starts with reasoning, retrieves knowledge from a graph, performs a vector search, suggests diagnostic commands, generates a solution, and assigns it to the final answer. The user wants more robustness and actionable steps, so I need to modify the plan to include these changes.\\n\\nThe first step is to update the reasoning phase to include the new focus on diagnostic commands and configuration validation. I'll modify the chain_of_thoughts to mention using 'pd-ctl member list' and other relevant commands.\\n\\nNext, I'll adjust the vector_search step to include a more specific query, ensuring it retrieves concrete examples from official documentation. This should help in providing more actionable solutions.\\n\\nThen, I need to add a new step after the vector_search to suggest specific PD diagnostic commands and configuration validation steps. This will involve using the llm_generate tool to provide a detailed guide for verifying the cluster's configuration.\\n\\nAfter that, the existing llm_generate step for the solution should incorporate these new commands and validation steps, ensuring the solution is comprehensive and actionable. I'll modify the prompt to include the new variables, making sure the solution is well-rounded.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that all steps maintain referential integrity and that the output variables are correctly referenced. Since the program counter is at step 2, I'll start modifying from step 3 onwards, keeping the earlier steps unchanged.\\n\\nFinally, I'll make sure the updated plan aligns with the VM specifications, using only the available tools and ensuring that the final answer variable is correctly assigned.\\n\\nBy following these steps, the plan should now include the user's suggestions, making it more robust and actionable for resolving the configuration inconsistencies in the TiDB cluster.\", 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': \"The configuration inconsistency warnings related to the initial-cluster and join configurations in a TiDB cluster are likely due to mismatches in the PD node configurations.

This involves understanding the error, analyzing system metrics, and implementing targeted solutions. Here’s a step-by-step guide:\\n\\n### Understanding the Error\\n\\n1. **RegionMiss Error**: This error occurs when TiDB\\'s region information is outdated. TiKV returns a `regionMiss` error, prompting TiDB to fetch updated region data from the Placement Driver (PD). This process uses a backoff mechanism, which introduces delays as TiDB waits before retrying the request.\\n\\n2. **Backoff Mechanism**: TiDB employs a backoff strategy to manage failed RPC requests. If the retries take too long, the accumulated backoff time can exceed the maximum allowed sleep time, resulting in the error.\\n\\n### Troubleshooting Steps\\n\\n1. **Monitor and Analyze Logs**:\\n   - **Slow Query Logs**: Regularly review these logs to understand the frequency and duration of `regionMiss` errors. This can help identify patterns and potential bottlenecks.\\n   - **Cop_backoff Metrics**: Monitor these metrics to assess the impact of backoff delays on query performance.\\n\\n2. **Optimize Configuration**:\\n   - **Backoff Settings**: Adjust the backoff configuration to better handle retries. This may involve tuning parameters like the initial backoff time and the maximum number of retries to align with your workload and network conditions.\\n\\n3. **Upgrade TiDB Components**:\\n   - **Latest Versions**: Ensure that TiDB, TiKV, and PD are updated to the latest stable versions. Updates often include bug fixes and performance improvements that can resolve known issues.\\n\\n4. **Investigate TiKV and PD Logs**:\\n   - **Log Analysis**: Examine logs from TiKV and PD for anomalies or errors related to region information updates and RPC requests. This can help pinpoint specific regions or nodes causing delays.\\n\\n5. **Review Network and Infrastructure**:\\n   - **Network Optimization**: Ensure that your network infrastructure supports low latency and high throughput. Network issues can exacerbate delays in retrieving region information from PD.\\n\\n6. **Analyze Stale Read and Resolved Timestamps**:\\n   - **Resolved Timestamps (TS)**: Check metrics related to resolved timestamps and region read progress. Ensuring timely updates of resolved-ts is crucial to prevent stale reads and outdated region information.\\n\\n7. **Troubleshooting Tips**:\\n   - **Coprocessor Queue and Region Cache**: Investigate these areas for potential issues. Delays here can contribute to the error.\\n\\n### Implementing Solutions\\n\\n- **Regular Monitoring**: Set up alerts and dashboards to continuously monitor slow queries and backoff metrics. This proactive approach can help in early detection of issues.\\n- **Configuration Tuning**: Experiment with different backoff configurations to find the optimal settings for your environment.\\n- **System Updates**: Schedule regular updates of TiDB components to benefit from the latest improvements and fixes.\\n- **Network Checks**: Conduct regular network performance tests to ensure optimal conditions for TiDB operations.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can effectively address the \"regionMiss backoffer.maxSleep 40000ms is exceeded\" error, enhancing the performance and reliability of your TiDB system.', 'reasoning': 'To troubleshoot and resolve the \"regionMiss backoffer.maxSleep 40000ms is exceeded\" error in TiDB, we need to understand the context and potential causes of this error.

Implement a mechanism to automatically refresh the region cache when a RegionMiss error is detected. This can be done by configuring TiDB to fetch the latest region information from PD more aggressively.\\n\\n- **Optimize Network Configuration**:\\n  - **Symptom**: High network latency or packet loss.\\n  - **Action**: Review and optimize the network setup between TiDB and PD. Ensure that the network is configured for low latency and high reliability. This may involve upgrading network hardware, optimizing routing paths, or increasing bandwidth.\\n\\n- **Increase Backoff Time**:\\n  - **Symptom**: Persistent errors despite updated region information.\\n  - **Action**: Temporarily increase the maximum backoff time beyond 40000ms to allow more time for TiDB to retrieve region information.

For further guidance, refer to the official TiDB documentation and community resources.\", 'reasoning': 'Okay, so I need to help update the plan based on the suggestions provided. Let me start by understanding the current situation and the suggestions.\\n\\nThe original plan was designed to troubleshoot the \"regionMiss backoffer.maxSleep 40000ms is exceeded\" error in TiDB. It involved several steps, including retrieving knowledge from a knowledge graph, performing a vector search, combining insights, proposing a solution, and assigning the final answer. The current program counter is at step 1, meaning the next steps are yet to be executed.\\n\\nThe suggestions mention adding a validation step between the knowledge graph and vector search results to ensure consistency. Also, a final review step using llm_generate to map each recommendation to the error symptoms is proposed. This should enhance the logical flow and result in a more accurate answer.\\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll analyze the current plan. After step 0 (reasoning), step 1 assigns the error message. Then, steps 2 and 3 retrieve information using retrieve_knowledge_graph and vector_search, respectively. Steps 4 and 5 combine these insights and propose a solution, which is then assigned as the final answer.\\n\\nThe suggestions want to add a validation step after retrieving both sets of data. This means after step 3, we should add a step to compare and cross-reference the knowledge graph and vector search results. This will ensure that the information is consistent and reliable before proceeding to generate insights.\\n\\nAdditionally, a final review step is needed to explicitly map each troubleshooting recommendation to the specific error symptoms. This will help in ensuring that the solution is directly tied to the problem at hand, making it more effective.\\n\\nSo, the plan needs to be updated to include these new steps. Let me outline the changes:\\n\\n1. After step 3 (vector_search), insert a new step (seq_no=4) to validate and cross-reference the results from region_miss_kg_info and region_miss_vector_info. This can be done using an llm_generate tool to analyze and ensure consistency.\\n\\n2. Then, proceed with combining the insights (step 4 becomes step 5), but adjust the context to include the validated information.\\n\\n3. After generating the proposed solution, add a final review step (seq_no=6) to map each recommendation to the error symptoms, ensuring relevance and accuracy.\\n\\n4. Finally, assign the final answer as before.\\n\\nI need to make sure that all steps are correctly numbered and that variables are properly referenced. Also, each new step should be inserted in the correct sequence without disrupting the flow.\\n\\nLet me sketch the updated plan:\\n\\n- Step 0: Reasoning (unchanged)\\n- Step 1: Assign error message (unchanged)\\n- Step 2: retrieve_knowledge_graph (unchanged)\\n- Step 3: vector_search (unchanged)\\n- Step 4: Validate and cross-reference results\\n- Step 5: Combine insights with validation\\n- Step 6: Final review mapping recommendations\\n- Step 7: Assign final answer\\n\\nWait, but the original plan had steps up to 6, so inserting new steps would shift the subsequent steps. Alternatively, perhaps the new steps can be integrated into the existing structure without shifting, but that might complicate variable references.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to restructure the plan to include the new steps after step 3, adjusting the subsequent steps accordingly.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that each new step correctly references the necessary variables and that the output variables are appropriately named for later use.\\n\\nAnother consideration is maintaining the goal alignment and ensuring that each step contributes directly to resolving the error. The validation step should help in ensuring that the information gathered is accurate and relevant, while the final review ensures that the solution is tailored to the specific error.\\n\\nI should also check for any potential redundancies or inefficiencies introduced by the new steps and adjust accordingly to maintain efficiency.\\n\\nIn summary, the plan needs to be updated by adding two new steps: one for validating the retrieved information and another for reviewing the proposed solution against the error symptoms.

Table，定期分析表结构，确保统计信息准确，帮助优化器做出更好的执行计划。此外，调整TiDB的配置参数，比如调整内存分配，也可以提升性能。\\n\\n在生成SQL时，建议用户使用绑定变量，避免SQL注入，同时提升性能。最后，监控工具如Prometheus和 Grafana可以帮助用户实时监控数据库性能，及时发现和解决问题。\\n\\n综上所述，我需要提供一个详细的步骤，帮助用户从分析需求开始，逐步优化查询，确保每个步骤都清晰明了，最终实现高效的查询。', 'plan': [{'parameters': {'goal': '从TiDB中高效检索特定数据'}, 'seq_no': 0, 'type': 'assign'}, {'parameters':

It is designed to handle large-scale data storage and processing, ensuring data consistency through log replication using the Raft consensus algorithm. TiKV is horizontally scalable, meaning you can add or remove nodes to adjust the cluster's capacity and performance.\\n\\n### Scaling TiKV Nodes\\n\\n**Horizontal Scaling**: This involves adding (scale-out) or removing (scale-in) TiKV nodes in a cluster. Scaling out is typically done to increase the cluster's capacity and performance, especially when facing high resource usage or bottlenecks. Conversely, scaling in reduces the number of nodes, which might be necessary for cost optimization or when the workload decreases.\\n\\n- **Scale-out**: When you add more TiKV instances, the data is redistributed across the new nodes. This process helps resolve single-thread bottlenecks and addresses high resource usage. The scaling out process requires scaling the corresponding node groups in cloud environments like AWS EKS or Azure AKS to ensure sufficient resources.\\n\\n- **Scale-in**: This involves reducing the number of TiKV instances. During this process, data from the nodes being removed is migrated to other nodes in the cluster. The TiKV Operator manages this process, ensuring data consistency and availability.\\n\\n### Rebalancing and Region Management\\n\\n**Region Balance Scheduling**: TiKV divides its key-value space into key ranges called Regions. Each Region is distributed across the cluster to ensure even data distribution and load balancing. The Placement Driver (PD) component of TiDB is responsible for managing the distribution of these Regions across TiKV nodes.\\n\\n- **Automatic Rebalancing**: TiDB automatically rebalances Regions as needed to maintain an even distribution of data and workload across the cluster. This rebalancing is crucial for maintaining performance and avoiding hotspots, where some nodes might become overloaded while others are underutilized.\\n\\n- **Leader Balancing**: After scaling operations or node restarts, TiDB accelerates leader balancing to ensure that the load is evenly distributed among the available nodes. This process is essential for maintaining optimal performance and quick recovery of business operations.\\n\\n### Implications of Scaling and Rebalancing\\n\\n- **Performance**: Proper scaling and rebalancing ensure that the cluster can handle increased workloads efficiently. By distributing data and load evenly, TiKV can maintain high throughput and low latency.\\n\\n- **Resource Utilization**: Scaling allows for better resource utilization by adjusting the number of nodes to match the workload. This flexibility helps in optimizing costs and ensuring that resources are not wasted.\\n\\n- **Data Consistency and Availability**: The Raft consensus algorithm ensures that data remains consistent across all replicas, even during scaling and rebalancing operations. This consistency is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the database.\\n\\nIn summary, TiKV's ability to scale and rebalance dynamically is a key feature that supports TiDB's performance and reliability.

Here\\'s a detailed explanation of the process:\\n\\n### Overview of TiKV and TiDB Scaling\\n\\nTiKV is the transactional storage layer in TiDB, responsible for storing OLTP data. It is horizontally scalable, meaning you can add or remove nodes to adjust the cluster\\'s capacity and performance. When scaling down, the number of TiKV nodes is reduced, which involves redistributing data and ensuring that the cluster remains balanced and healthy.\\n\\n### Steps to Scale Down TiKV Nodes\\n\\n1. **Initiate Scale-In Process**: \\n   - Use the TiDB management tools like TiUP or TiDB Operator to initiate the scale-in process. This involves specifying the nodes to be removed from the cluster.\\n\\n2. **Data Migration**:\\n   - Before a TiKV node is removed, the data it holds must be migrated to other nodes. This is managed by the Placement Driver (PD), which is responsible for data distribution and balancing in the cluster.\\n   - PD marks the TiKV node as \"offline\" and begins migrating its data to other nodes. This process involves moving the Regions (the basic unit of data distribution in TiKV) to other nodes.\\n\\n3. **Rebalancing**:\\n   - Rebalancing is a critical part of scaling down. It ensures that data is evenly distributed across the remaining nodes to prevent hotspots and ensure optimal performance.\\n   - PD continuously monitors the cluster and adjusts the distribution of Regions to maintain balance. This involves moving Regions between nodes to ensure that no single node is overloaded.\\n\\n4. **Node Removal**:\\n   - Once all data has been successfully migrated, the TiKV node can be safely removed from the cluster. The node is then decommissioned, and its resources are freed up.\\n\\n5. **Cluster Health Monitoring**:\\n   - Throughout the scaling process, it\\'s essential to monitor the cluster\\'s health. This includes checking the status of data migration, ensuring that all nodes are functioning correctly, and verifying that the cluster remains balanced.\\n   - Tools like Grafana can be used to monitor metrics such as CPU usage, disk I/O, and network traffic to ensure that the cluster is performing optimally.\\n\\n### Impact on Cluster Health and Performance\\n\\n- **Data Availability**: TiKV uses the Raft consensus algorithm to ensure data availability and consistency.

Here\\'s a detailed explanation of the process, including the role of rebalancing, data redistribution, and maintaining cluster health.\\n\\n### Process of Scaling Down TiKV Nodes\\n\\n1. **Initiate Scale-In Operation**: \\n   - Use tools like TiUP or TiDB Operator to initiate the scale-in process. This involves marking the nodes to be removed as offline. For example, using TiUP, you can execute:\\n     ```shell\\n     tiup cluster scale-in <cluster-name> --node <node-ip>:<port>\\n     ```\\n\\n2. **Data Migration**:\\n   - Once a node is marked offline, TiDB\\'s Placement Driver (PD) begins redistributing the data stored on that node to other nodes in the cluster. This is done to ensure that all data remains available even after the node is removed.\\n   - The data migration process involves moving the Regions (the basic unit of data distribution in TiKV) from the nodes being removed to the remaining nodes. This process is managed by PD, which ensures that the data is evenly distributed across the remaining nodes.\\n\\n3. **Rebalancing**:\\n   - Rebalancing is a critical part of scaling operations. It ensures that the load is evenly distributed across the cluster, preventing any single node from becoming a bottleneck.\\n   - PD continuously monitors the distribution of Regions and replicas across the cluster and makes adjustments as needed to maintain balance. This includes moving Regions between nodes to ensure even distribution and optimal performance.\\n\\n4. **Node Removal**:\\n   - After data migration is complete and the node is no longer hosting any Regions, it can be safely removed from the cluster. The node\\'s status changes to \"Tombstone,\" indicating that it is no longer part of the cluster.\\n\\n5. **Cluster Configuration Update**:\\n   - Update the cluster configuration to reflect the new topology. This may involve refreshing the Prometheus configuration and restarting monitoring services to ensure accurate cluster monitoring.\\n\\n### Impact on Cluster Health\\n\\n- **Data Availability**: TiKV uses the Raft consensus algorithm to maintain multiple replicas of each Region. This ensures that data remains available even if a node is removed.\\n- **Performance**: During the scale-in process, there may be a temporary impact on performance due to data migration. However, once the process is complete, the cluster should stabilize with balanced load distribution.\\n- **Monitoring**: It\\'s crucial to monitor the cluster\\'s health during and after the scale-in process. This includes checking PD metrics, TiKV store status, and overall cluster performance.\\n\\n### Checklist for Monitoring Cluster Health\\n\\n1. **PD Metrics**: Monitor PD metrics to ensure that Regions are evenly distributed and that there are no hotspots. Key metrics include Region count per store and leader distribution.\\n2. **TiKV Store Status**: Check the status of TiKV stores to ensure that all nodes are healthy and that there are no nodes in an unexpected state (e.g., \"Tombstone\" or \"Offline\").\\n3. **Cluster Performance**: Monitor overall cluster performance, including query latency and throughput, to ensure that the cluster is operating efficiently.\\n4. **Rebalancing Progress**: Use tools like Grafana to visualize the rebalancing progress and ensure that the cluster is balanced after scaling.\\n\\n### Official TiDB Documentation References\\n\\n- **PD Metrics**: For detailed information on PD metrics and how to monitor them, refer to the [TiDB documentation on PD metrics](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/pd-control).\\n- **Rebalancing Best Practices**: For best practices on rebalancing and maintaining cluster health, refer to the [TiDB documentation on cluster management](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/maintain-tidb-cluster).\\n\\nBy following these steps and monitoring the cluster\\'s health, you can ensure a smooth and efficient scale-in process while maintaining data availability and performance.', 'reasoning': \"Alright, let's tackle this problem.

This parameter is crucial for managing the load on the TiCDC server and ensuring efficient data replication.\\n\\n### Purpose\\nThe primary purpose of the `region-scan-limit` is to optimize the performance of TiCDC by controlling the concurrency of region scanning. This helps in balancing the load on the system and preventing any potential bottlenecks that might arise from excessive concurrent scans.\\n\\n### Default Values\\nThe default value for `region-scan-limit` is typically set to a moderate level to ensure a balance between performance and resource usage. However, the exact default value can vary based on the version and specific configuration of the TiCDC deployment.\\n\\n### Impact on Performance\\n- **Higher Values**: Setting a higher `region-scan-limit` can increase the throughput of data capture by allowing more regions to be scanned simultaneously. However, this can also lead to increased resource consumption, potentially affecting the stability of the system if not managed properly.\\n- **Lower Values**: Conversely, a lower `region-scan-limit` reduces the concurrency of scans, which might decrease the load on the system but can also slow down the data capture process.\\n\\n### Configuration Recommendations\\n- **System Capacity**: Adjust the `region-scan-limit` based on the capacity of your system. If your system has ample resources, you might consider increasing the limit to improve throughput.\\n- **Load Testing**: It is advisable to perform load testing to determine the optimal setting for your specific environment. This helps in understanding the impact of different configurations on performance and resource usage.\\n\\n### Interaction with Other Parameters\\nThe `region-scan-limit` interacts with parameters like `region-threshold`, which determines the conditions under which regions are split or merged. For instance, if the `region-threshold` is set to a high value, it might result in fewer but larger regions, which could affect how the `region-scan-limit` is configured to ensure efficient scanning.\\n\\n### Example Scenario\\nConsider a scenario where a TiCDC deployment is experiencing high latency in data capture due to a large number of regions.

This parameter is crucial for managing the load on the TiCDC server and ensuring efficient data replication.\\n\\n### Purpose\\nThe primary purpose of the `region-scan-limit` is to optimize the performance of TiCDC by controlling the concurrency of region scanning. This helps in balancing the load on the system and preventing any potential bottlenecks that might arise from scanning too many regions simultaneously.\\n\\n### Default Values\\nThe default value for `region-scan-limit` is typically set to a moderate number that balances performance and resource usage. However, the exact default value can vary based on the version and specific configuration of the TiCDC deployment.\\n\\n### Impact on Performance\\n- **Higher Values**: Setting a higher `region-scan-limit` can increase the throughput of data capture by allowing more regions to be scanned concurrently. However, this can also lead to increased resource consumption, such as CPU and memory usage, which might affect the stability of the TiCDC server if not properly managed.\\n- **Lower Values**: Conversely, a lower `region-scan-limit` reduces the concurrency of region scanning, which can help in conserving resources but might also slow down the data capture process, especially in high-throughput environments.\\n\\n### Configuration Recommendations\\n- **Resource Availability**: Adjust the `region-scan-limit` based on the available resources of your TiCDC server. Ensure that the server has sufficient CPU and memory to handle the configured limit without impacting other operations.\\n- **Workload Characteristics**: Consider the characteristics of your workload. For instance, if your workload involves a large number of small transactions, a higher limit might be beneficial. Conversely, for workloads with fewer, larger transactions, a lower limit might suffice.\\n\\n### Interaction with Other Parameters\\nThe `region-scan-limit` interacts with parameters like `region-threshold`, which determines when a region should be split based on its size or traffic. Together, these parameters help in optimizing the data capture process by ensuring that regions are scanned efficiently and that the load is distributed evenly across the TiCDC nodes.\\n\\n### Example Scenario\\nConsider a scenario where a TiCDC server is experiencing high CPU usage due to a large number of regions being scanned concurrently. In this case, reducing the `region-scan-limit` can help in lowering the CPU usage, thereby stabilizing the server's performance. Conversely, if the data capture process is lagging behind, increasing the `region-scan-limit` might help in catching up with the data changes more quickly.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on configuring TiCDC and related parameters, you can refer to the official documentation: [TiCDC Configuration](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/ticdc-server-config).\", 'reasoning': 'Alright, I need to address the user\\'s request to update the VM execution plan based on the provided suggestions.

Let me go through this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I'll look at the original plan. It had three steps: retrieving knowledge from the knowledge graph, doing a vector search, and then generating the final answer with an LLM. The user's suggestion mentioned adding a step to compare the outputs from the knowledge graph and vector search to ensure consistency. Also, a validation step was suggested to cross-reference the SQL query with the latest TiDB documentation. Additionally, the plan could benefit from explaining how to interpret certain columns and providing alternative queries.\\n\\nSo, the first thing I need to do is figure out where these new steps fit into the existing plan.

This step will check if the SQL query is up to date by cross-referencing it with the latest TiDB documentation. Again, using `llm_generate` makes sense here as it can review the query and the documentation snippet.\\n\\nAfter validation, it's a good idea to provide additional explanations. This could include interpreting columns like AVAILABLE and PROGRESS, as well as offering alternative queries. This step ensures the answer is comprehensive and helpful for users who might have follow-up questions.\\n\\nFinally, I'll add a step to compile all these insights into a coherent final answer. This ensures that all the information gathered and validated is presented clearly to the user.\\n\\nI also need to make sure that each new step increments the `seq_no` correctly and that all output variables are properly referenced. Since the original plan ended at step 2, the new steps will start at 3 and go up to 6.\\n\\nAnother consideration is maintaining the flow of the plan. Each new step should logically follow the previous one, ensuring that the data is processed and validated before being presented as the final answer. This maintains efficiency and ensures that the plan remains goal-aligned.\\n\\nI should also check that I'm not introducing any redundant steps or unnecessary complexity. Each added step should directly contribute to improving the answer's quality and completeness based on the suggestions.\\n\\nLastly, I'll ensure that the final answer variable is correctly assigned in the last step, as per the VM's requirements.

Retrieve knowledge graph data about TiDB system tables related to TiFlash replication.\\n2. Perform a vector search for SQL queries that identify TiFlash-replicated tables.\\n3. Use an LLM to generate the final answer based on the retrieved knowledge and vector search results.\\n\\nThe user\\'s suggestion is to add a reconciliation step to compare the SQL query samples from both the knowledge graph and vector search. This step should verify the accuracy of the query against the latest TiDB documentation. Additionally, the final answer should include explanations of each result column, version-specific notes, and reference links.\\n\\nSo, I need to modify the plan to include these changes. Let me break down the steps.\\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll keep the initial steps unchanged. That means steps 0 and 1 remain as they are. After that, I need to add a new step before the final LLM generation. This new step will reconcile the results from the knowledge graph and vector search.\\n\\nIn the new reconciliation step, I\\'ll use the LLM to analyze both sets of data. The prompt will instruct the LLM to compare the SQL queries, ensure consistency, check for any discrepancies, and validate against the latest TiDB documentation. The output of this step will be stored in a new variable, say \"reconciliation_result\".\\n\\nNext, the final LLM generation step will now take into account this reconciliation result. The prompt will be updated to include the need for explaining each column, noting version-specific changes, and providing reference links. The output will still be stored in \"final_answer\".\\n\\nI need to ensure that all steps are correctly numbered and that the new step is inserted in the right place. Also, I must make sure that the output variables from previous steps are correctly referenced.\\n\\nLet me outline the changes:\\n1. Add a new step after step 1 (vector search) to reconcile the results.\\n2. Update the final LLM step to include the reconciliation result and the new requirements.\\n\\nI should also check if the new variables are correctly assigned and if there are any dependencies that need to be handled.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll structure the updated plan as a JSON array, ensuring that the sequence numbers are correct and that all instructions are properly formatted.', 'plan': [{'parameters': {'output_vars': ['tiflash_system_tables_kg'], 'tool_name': 'retrieve_knowledge_graph', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB system tables related to TiFlash replication'}}, 'seq_no': 0, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['tiflash_sql_queries_vector'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'SQL query to identify tables with TiFlash replication in TiDB', 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 1, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['reconciliation_result'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': 'Knowledge Graph data: ${tiflash_system_tables_kg}\\nVector Search data: ${tiflash_sql_queries_vector}', 'prompt': 'Compare the SQL query samples from the knowledge graph and vector search.

场景三：已有自增ID\\n对于有自增ID的表，我们可以利用自增ID来快速识别和删除重复项。\\n\\n```sql\\nDELETE FROM your_table\\nWHERE id NOT IN (\\n    SELECT MIN(id) FROM your_table\\n    GROUP BY column1,

This means that users need to use alternative methods to achieve similar results.\\n\\n2. **Using SUBSTRING_INDEX()**: The `SUBSTRING_INDEX()` function can be used to split a string by a specified delimiter and return a substring. This function is particularly useful when you want to extract a specific part of a string based on its position relative to a delimiter.\\n\\n3. **Example SQL Query**:\\n   Suppose you want to split the string `'分割'` by a specific delimiter, such as a comma `,`. You can use the `SUBSTRING_INDEX()` function to achieve this. However, since `'分割'` does not contain a delimiter, let's assume a more practical example where the string is `'分,割'`.\\n\\n   ```sql\\n   SELECT \\n       SUBSTRING_INDEX('分,割', ',', 1) AS FirstPart,\\n       SUBSTRING_INDEX('分,割', ',', -1) AS SecondPart;\\n   ```\\n\\n   - **Explanation of the Query**:\\n     - `SUBSTRING_INDEX('分,割', ',', 1)`: This part of the query extracts the first part of the string before the first comma, resulting in `'分'`.\\n     - `SUBSTRING_INDEX('分,割', ',', -1)`: This part extracts the last part of the string after the last comma, resulting in `'割'`.\\n\\nThis method allows you to simulate the splitting of a string into parts using available functions in TiDB.

OLTP 场景中，程序发送到数据库的 SQL 语句类型有限，因此建议使用 Prepared Statements 来避免重复解析和生成 SQL 执行计划的开销。使用 `useServerPrepStmts = true` 配置参数可以在 TiDB 服务器上进行语句预处理。\\n\\n2. **使用批处理 API**：对于批量插入操作，可以使用 `addBatch` 和 `executeBatch` API。为了减少网络传输的开销，可以配置 `rewriteBatchedStatements = true`。\\n\\n3. **使用 StreamingResult 获取执行结果**：对于返回超大结果集的查询，建议使用 `StreamingResult` 来逐步获取数据，避免客户端内存占用过多。\\n\\n### 内存控制机制\\n\\nTiDB 提供了多种内存控制机制，以防止内存使用过高导致的性能问题：\\n\\n1. **tidb_mem_quota_query**：这是一个系统变量，用于限制单个 SQL 执行的内存使用量。当内存使用超过限制时，TiDB 可以根据 `OOMAction` 配置项选择是记录日志还是取消 SQL 执行。\\n\\n2. **tidb_dml_type**：为了减少大事务导致的内存使用，可以将 `tidb_dml_type` 系统变量设置为 `\"bulk\"`，或者使用非事务性 DML 语句。\\n\\n3. **流量控制**：TiDB 支持动态内存控制，通过减少读取数据的线程数来控制内存使用。当单个 SQL 执行的内存使用超过 `tidb_mem_quota_query` 时，读取数据的操作会停止一个线程。\\n\\n通过合理配置连接池和内存控制机制，TiDB

This feature enhances the stability of multi-application clusters by ensuring that resource consumption is controlled and isolated, preventing one workload from affecting others. This isolation is crucial for monitoring as it allows administrators to track resource usage per group, ensuring that each workload operates within its allocated resources. This is particularly beneficial for identifying and diagnosing issues related to resource contention or overconsumption. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-7.1.0)\\n\\n2. **Dynamic Resource Management**: TiDB 7.1.0 introduces the ability to dynamically manage resources at both session and statement levels. This includes setting resource groups for specific sessions or statements, allowing for more granular control over resource allocation. This dynamic management is reflected in monitoring metrics, where administrators can observe the resource unit (RU) consumption and the time spent waiting for resources. These metrics are crucial for diagnosing performance issues and ensuring that resources are being used efficiently. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/release-7.5.1)\\n\\n3. **Dashboard Integration**: TiDB provides visual charts of resource control metrics in Grafana's **TiDB** > **Resource Control** dashboard.

[Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/tidb-resource-control)\\n\\n**Monitoring Metrics Examples**:\\n- **RU Consumption**: This metric indicates the resource units consumed by SQL statements, helping to identify queries that are resource-intensive.\\n- **CPU Usage**: Monitoring CPU usage per resource group helps in understanding the processing load and identifying potential bottlenecks.\\n- **Dashboard Visualizations**: The Grafana dashboard provides visualizations of these metrics, allowing for easy tracking and analysis of resource usage patterns.\\n\\n**Caveats and Limitations**:\\n- The resource control feature does not impact the regular usage of data import, export, and other replication tools. Tools like BR, TiDB Lightning, and TiCDC do not currently support processing DDL operations related to resource control, and their resource consumption is not limited by resource control. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/tidb-resource-control)\\n- Users who do not specify any resource groups will be bound to the `default` resource group, which has unlimited resources.

Diese Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) Fähigkeit macht TiDB zu einer attraktiven Option für den Aufbau von Anwendungen, die sowohl Echtzeit-Transaktionen als auch Datenanalysen erfordern.\\n\\n### Transaktionsfähigkeiten\\nTiDB bietet zwei Haupttransaktionsmodi: optimistische und pessimistische Transaktionen. Optimistische Transaktionen sind effizient, wenn Konflikte selten sind, während pessimistische Transaktionen bei hoher Konfliktwahrscheinlichkeit die Konsistenz sicherstellen. Beide Modi unterstützen ACID-Transaktionen, was für Anwendungen, die starke Konsistenz erfordern, wie z.B. Finanztransaktionen, entscheidend ist. Weitere Informationen zu den Transaktionsfähigkeiten finden Sie in der [TiDB-Dokumentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/optimistic-transaction).\\n\\n### Analytische Fähigkeiten\\nTiDB integriert TiKV für zeilenbasierte Speicherung und TiFlash für spaltenbasierte Speicherung, was es ermöglicht, sowohl transaktionale als auch analytische Workloads effizient zu verarbeiten. Diese Architektur ist besonders vorteilhaft für Echtzeitanalysen großer Datenmengen. Die Fähigkeit, komplexe analytische Abfragen schnell auszuführen, ist ein wesentlicher Vorteil für Anwendungen, die schnelle Einblicke in Daten benötigen. Weitere Details zur Architektur finden Sie [hier](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview).\\n\\n### Skalierbarkeitsmerkmale\\nTiDB bietet horizontale Skalierbarkeit, die es ermöglicht, die Kapazität durch das Hinzufügen weiterer Knoten zu erhöhen. Diese Flexibilität ist besonders nützlich für Anwendungen mit schnell wachsenden Datenanforderungen. Die Trennung von Rechenleistung und Speicherung ermöglicht eine dynamische Anpassung der Ressourcen, ohne den Betrieb zu unterbrechen. Weitere Informationen zur Skalierbarkeit finden Sie in der [TiDB-Dokumentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/overview).\\n\\n### Kosteneffektivität\\nTiDB ist kosteneffizient, da es sowohl OLTP als auch OLAP in einem System unterstützt, was die Notwendigkeit separater Datenbanken reduziert. Die automatische Auswahl zwischen TiKV und TiFlash basierend auf Kostenoptimierung hilft, die Betriebskosten zu senken. Die Kompatibilität mit dem MySQL-Protokoll erleichtert die Migration bestehender Anwendungen, was Zeit und Kosten spart.

Hier sind die Gründe, warum TiDB eine geeignete Wahl sein könnte:\\n\\n### Transaktionsfähigkeiten\\nTiDB unterstützt sowohl optimistische als auch pessimistische Transaktionen, was Entwicklern Flexibilität bei der Wahl der besten Strategie für ihre spezifischen Anwendungsfälle bietet. Optimistische Transaktionen sind effizient in Szenarien mit seltenen Konflikten, während pessimistische Transaktionen ideal für Umgebungen mit häufigen Datenkonflikten sind. TiDB gewährleistet ACID-Transaktionen, was besonders wichtig für Anwendungen ist, die starke Konsistenz erfordern, wie z.B. Banktransaktionen. Weitere Informationen finden Sie in der [TiDB-Dokumentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/optimistic-transaction).\\n\\n### Analytische Fähigkeiten\\nTiDB unterstützt sowohl OLTP als auch OLAP, was es zu einer echten HTAP-Datenbank macht. Die Integration von TiFlash, einer spaltenbasierten Speicher-Engine, ermöglicht es, analytische Abfragen effizient zu verarbeiten. Dies ist besonders nützlich für Echtzeitanalysen, da sowohl transaktionale als auch analytische Abfragen innerhalb desselben Systems ausgeführt werden können. Weitere Details finden Sie in der [TiDB-Dokumentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview).\\n\\n### Skalierbarkeitsmerkmale\\nTiDB ist für horizontale Skalierbarkeit ausgelegt, was bedeutet, dass die Kapazität durch das Hinzufügen weiterer Knoten erweitert werden kann. Diese Architektur trennt Rechen- und Speicherressourcen, was eine einfache Skalierung ohne Ausfallzeiten ermöglicht. Dies ist besonders vorteilhaft für Anwendungen mit hohem Datenvolumen und hoher Parallelität. Weitere Informationen zur Architektur finden Sie [hier](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/tidb-architecture).\\n\\n### Kosteneffektivität\\nDie Trennung von Rechen- und Speicherkapazitäten in TiDB ermöglicht eine flexible Ressourcennutzung, was die Betriebskosten senkt. Die Unterstützung von HTAP reduziert die Notwendigkeit für separate Systeme für OLTP und OLAP, was die Gesamtbetriebskosten weiter senkt. TiDB ist auch mit dem MySQL-Protokoll kompatibel, was die Migration bestehender Anwendungen erleichtert. Weitere Informationen zur Kosteneffizienz finden Sie [hier](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview).\\n\\n### AI-Unterstützung\\nTiDB bietet eine robuste Plattform für Anwendungen, die Echtzeitanalysen und hohe Datenkonsistenz erfordern, was für AI-gestützte Apps wie FocusFlow AI von Vorteil ist. Die Fähigkeit, große Datenmengen effizient zu verarbeiten und zu analysieren, unterstützt die Entwicklung von AI-Funktionen, die auf Echtzeitdaten angewiesen sind.\\n\\nZusammenfassend bietet TiDB eine flexible, skalierbare und kosteneffiziente Lösung, die sowohl transaktionale als auch analytische Anforderungen erfüllt, was sie zu einer geeigneten Wahl für den Aufbau einer kleinen App wie FocusFlow AI macht.', 'reasoning': \"Okay, I need to analyze the current plan and update it based on the suggestions provided. The user wants to determine if TiDB is suitable for building a small app like FocusFlow AI, which involves task management, note-taking, and AI integration. The current plan evaluates TiDB's transactional capabilities, analytical capabilities, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. However, the suggestions indicate that additional aspects should be considered, such as AI integration support, persistent context management, latency requirements, MySQL compatibility, security, and failover mechanisms. \\n\\nFirst, I'll review the suggestions. They mention adding a step to gather information about TiDB's support for AI integrations and persistent context. Also, the context of all queries should be expanded to include latency, MySQL compatibility, security, and failover. Finally, a validation step is suggested to ensure the answer's completeness.\\n\\nLooking at the current plan, after step 0, which retrieves transactional capabilities from the knowledge graph, the next steps focus on transactional, analytical, scalability, and cost-effectiveness aspects. I need to modify the plan to incorporate the new requirements without disrupting the existing flow.\\n\\nI'll start by adding a new step after the initial transactional capabilities retrieval. This step will use vector_search to gather information on TiDB's support for AI integrations and persistent context. Then, I'll modify the existing vector_search steps to include additional parameters like latency, MySQL compatibility, security, and failover. \\n\\nNext, I'll adjust the llm_generate steps to include these new aspects in their prompts, ensuring that each explanation now covers the expanded criteria. After all the explanations are generated, I'll add a validation step using llm_generate to check if the answer addresses all necessary points, including AI integration, persistent context, and other new aspects.\\n\\nI must ensure that each tool call correctly references the variables and that the output variables are properly named. Also, I'll make sure that the final_answer combines all the explanations and the validation result. \\n\\nFinally, I'll structure the updated plan, keeping the initial steps up to step 0 unchanged and integrating the new steps and modifications seamlessly.

However, the suggestions recommend adding a preliminary step to explicitly check if the query is off-topic and include a disclaimer. They also suggest incorporating a dual retrieval practice, even if optional, to ensure consistency.\\n\\nLooking at the current plan, it starts with a reasoning step, then calls llm_generate, and assigns the final answer. The suggestions aim to add a check for off-topic queries before proceeding. This makes sense because it ensures that any similar queries are handled consistently.\\n\\nI'll need to add a new step after the initial reasoning. This step should check if the query is off-topic. If it is, the plan should proceed to inform the user. Since the query is already known to be off-topic, this step can be a conditional jump that always proceeds to the next step, ensuring the disclaimer is included.\\n\\nNext, I'll modify the existing llm_generate step to include a brief disclaimer about the scope of assistance and advise the user to check official sources for contact details. This aligns with the suggestions to provide a clearer message.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that the new step doesn't interfere with the existing flow.

The user is experiencing slow transaction commits in TiDB despite fast prewrite operations. The initial plan focused on gathering knowledge about the transaction commit process and related documentation but missed some crucial steps to diagnose the issue effectively.\\n\\nFirst, I considered the suggestions provided. They highlighted the need to retrieve specific metrics and logs related to the commit phase, such as commit timestamps and network latency. This makes sense because the prewrite phase is fast, so the bottleneck must lie elsewhere. Without detailed metrics, it's hard to pinpoint the exact cause.\\n\\nNext, I thought about how to incorporate these metrics into the plan. I decided to add a step using the `vector_search` tool to fetch relevant TiDB metrics documentation. This would help understand what metrics are available and how to interpret them. Then, another step was added to retrieve network latency logs, which could reveal if the network is causing delays.\\n\\nI also realized that the existing `vector_search` step was too broad. By narrowing the query to focus on the commit phase and 2PC optimizations, the retrieved documentation would be more targeted and useful. This change ensures that the information gathered is directly relevant to the problem.\\n\\nAnother consideration was enhancing the analysis step. The original plan used `llm_generate` to synthesize findings but didn't explicitly include the new metrics and logs. I updated the prompt to include these variables, ensuring that the analysis considers all potential causes, such as commit timestamp delays, network issues, and configuration parameters affecting 2PC.\\n\\nFinally, I made sure the plan remains efficient and avoids redundancy. By adding only necessary steps and refining existing ones, the plan becomes more effective without unnecessary complexity. I also ensured that the final answer variable is correctly assigned and that all steps are properly sequenced.\\n\\nIn summary, the key changes were adding steps to gather specific metrics and network logs, refining the vector search to target commit phase issues, and enhancing the analysis to include these new data points. This approach should provide a more comprehensive diagnosis and solution for the slow transaction commits.\", 'plan_commit_hash': '16c19e8c1e564e0bbbecd7dc655f9af5', 'answers': [{'commit_hash': '7241a4250c024c49a303b2ee733ce51b', 'committed_at': '2025-02-22T08:02:01', 'description': 'Executed seq_no: 4, step: assign', 'seq_no': 4, 'commit_type': 'StepExecution', 'parent_hash': '4449e3b0345c46f19ec6149bb73bdfa1', 'final_answer': 'The slow transaction commit issue in TiDB can be attributed to several factors related to the two-phase commit (2PC) protocol used for transaction management. Here is an analysis based on the provided information:\\n\\n### Root Causes:\\n1. **Transaction Contention and Conflicts**: TiDB uses a two-phase commit protocol to ensure atomicity and consistency across distributed nodes. Transaction contention and conflicts can occur, especially in optimistic transactions, where conflicts are detected at the commit phase. This can lead to slow transaction commits as transactions wait for locks to be resolved.\\n\\n2. **Large Transactions**: Transactions that involve a large number of keys or data can take longer to commit due to the increased time required for the prewrite and commit phases of the 2PC protocol. The prewrite phase locks the data, and if the commit phase is delayed, it can lead to prolonged lock holding.\\n\\n3. **Network and System Delays**: Delays in network communication between TiDB and TiKV nodes, or between TiDB and PD (Placement Driver), can slow down the transaction commit process. This includes delays in obtaining the commit timestamp (`get_commit_ts`) and in the communication required for the prewrite and commit phases.\\n\\n4. **Configuration Issues**: Misconfigurations, such as inappropriate settings for transaction size limits or concurrency controls, can lead to inefficiencies in transaction processing.\\n\\n5. **Garbage Collection (GC) Interference**: Although open transactions do not block GC, the timing of GC operations can still impact transaction performance if not properly managed.\\n\\n### Solutions:\\n1. **Optimize Transaction Size**: Ensure that transactions are not too large. Break down large transactions into smaller ones to reduce the time taken for each commit. This can be managed by adhering to the transaction size limits and optimizing the number of keys involved in each transaction.\\n\\n2. **Use Pessimistic Transactions**: For workloads with high contention, consider using pessimistic transactions instead of optimistic ones. Pessimistic transactions acquire locks earlier in the process, which can reduce the likelihood of conflicts at commit time.\\n\\n3. **Monitor and Adjust Configuration**: Regularly monitor transaction performance metrics and adjust configuration settings such as `tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt` and `tidb_ddl_reorg_batch_size` to optimize the performance of DDL operations and reduce their impact on transaction commits.\\n\\n4. **Improve Network and System Performance**: Ensure that the network infrastructure is optimized for low latency and high throughput. This includes ensuring that the TiDB, TiKV, and PD nodes are well-provisioned and that there are no bottlenecks in the system.\\n\\n5. **Analyze and Resolve Contention**: Use tools like the `CLUSTER_TIDB_TRX` table and TiKV logs to identify and resolve transaction contention issues. This can involve analyzing active transactions and understanding the reasons for lock contention.\\n\\n6. **Implement Application-Level Retries**: For optimistic transactions, implement application-level retry logic to handle commit failures gracefully. This involves catching specific error codes and retrying the transaction with exponential backoff.\\n\\nBy addressing these root causes and implementing the suggested solutions, the slow transaction commit issue in TiDB can be mitigated, leading to improved transaction performance and system efficiency.', 'reasoning': \"To address the issue of slow transaction commits in TiDB, despite fast prewrite operations, we need to investigate several potential causes.

Here's a detailed breakdown based on the provided documents and metrics:\\n\\n### Commit Phase Breakdown\\n\\n1. **Get Commit Timestamp (get_commit_ts):**\\n   - This step involves obtaining a globally unique timestamp from the Placement Driver (PD) to mark the transaction's commit point. The time consumed in this step is crucial as it directly impacts the overall commit duration. According to the execution information, the `get_commit_ts` can take several milliseconds, which can be a bottleneck if the PD is under heavy load or if there are network delays.\\n\\n2. **Actual Commit Duration:**\\n   - The actual commit phase involves writing the final transaction data to the TiKV nodes. This step is part of the two-phase commit (2PC) protocol, where the primary key is committed first, followed by the secondary keys. The `commit` duration can be affected by several factors, including network latency, the number of keys involved, and the load on the TiKV nodes.\\n\\n### Impact of Network Latency\\n\\n- Network latency can significantly affect both the `get_commit_ts` and the actual commit duration. High latency can lead to increased wait times for obtaining the commit timestamp and for the communication between TiDB and TiKV nodes during the commit phase. This is particularly critical in distributed systems like TiDB, where components are often spread across different nodes and potentially different data centers.\\n\\n### Transaction Size Issues\\n\\n- Large transactions can exacerbate commit delays. The size of a transaction is determined by the number of keys and the amount of data being written. Larger transactions require more time to process during the commit phase, as more data needs to be locked and written to the storage nodes. TiDB has a maximum transaction size limit, and exceeding this can lead to errors or increased commit times due to the need for additional processing and network communication.\\n\\n### Specific Metrics and Correlations\\n\\n- **Prewrite and Commit Durations:** The `prewrite` and `commit` metrics provide insights into the time taken for each phase of the 2PC protocol. High values in these metrics can indicate issues with transaction size or network latency.\\n- **Network Latency Metrics:** Monitoring network latency between TiDB and TiKV nodes can help identify if network delays are contributing to slow commits. This can be done by analyzing gRPC-related metrics and network latency dashboards.\\n- **Transaction Size Metrics:** Metrics related to the number of keys and the size of data being committed can help identify if large transactions are causing delays. This includes monitoring the `write_keys` and `write_byte` metrics.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nTo address slow transaction commits in TiDB, it is essential to monitor and optimize the `get_commit_ts` and `commit` durations, reduce network latency, and manage transaction sizes effectively.

This involves a prewrite phase and a commit phase. The prewrite phase locks the data, and the commit phase finalizes the transaction.\\n\\n2. **Commit Phase Metrics:**\\n   - **Prewrite:** Time taken to lock the data during the prewrite phase.\\n   - **Wait Prewrite Binlog:** Time spent waiting to write the prewrite Binlog.\\n   - **Get Commit TS:** Time taken to obtain the transaction commit timestamp.\\n   - **Commit:** Time taken to complete the commit phase.\\n\\n3. **Common Issues:**\\n   - **Long Prewrite or Commit Times:** These can be caused by network latency, high load on TiKV nodes, or large transaction sizes.\\n   - **Wait for Binlog:** Delays in writing binlogs can slow down the commit process.\\n   - **Get Commit TS Delays:** Delays in obtaining a commit timestamp from the Placement Driver (PD) can affect commit speed.\\n\\n### Potential Solutions\\n\\n1. **Optimize Network and Resource Allocation:**\\n   - Ensure that the network between TiDB and TiKV nodes is optimized to reduce latency.\\n   - Monitor and scale TiKV nodes to handle high loads effectively.\\n\\n2. **Transaction Size Management:**\\n   - Break down large transactions into smaller ones to reduce the load on the commit process.\\n   - Use batch operations where possible to optimize resource usage.\\n\\n3. **Monitor and Adjust Configuration:**\\n   - Use monitoring tools to track commit phase metrics and identify bottlenecks.\\n   - Adjust system variables related to transaction commit, such as `tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt` and `tidb_ddl_reorg_batch_size`, to optimize performance.\\n\\n4. **Review and Optimize Application Logic:**\\n   - Ensure that the application logic is optimized to handle transaction retries and errors, especially in optimistic transaction mode.\\n   - Use the `CLUSTER_TIDB_TRX` table to identify long-running transactions and optimize them.\\n\\n5. **Use Pessimistic Transactions for High Contention:**\\n   - In scenarios with high contention, consider using pessimistic transactions to avoid conflicts and retries.\\n\\nBy addressing these areas, you can potentially resolve slow transaction commit issues in TiDB and improve overall transaction performance.', 'reasoning': \"Okay, I need to update the plan based on the suggestions provided.

Based on the provided information, we can identify potential root causes and suggest solutions.\\n\\n### Root Causes\\n\\n1. **Get Commit Timestamp (get_commit_ts) Delay:**\\n   - The `get_commit_ts` process involves obtaining a timestamp from the Placement Driver (PD) to mark the commit time of a transaction. Delays in this process can occur due to network latency between TiDB and PD or if the PD is under heavy load.\\n\\n2. **Network Latency:**\\n   - Network latency can significantly impact the performance of distributed systems like TiDB. High latency between TiDB nodes, TiKV nodes, and PD can lead to increased transaction commit times. This is especially true if the nodes are not co-located in the same availability zone (AZ).\\n\\n3. **Binlog Wait Times:**\\n   - The `wait_prewrite_binlog` metric indicates the time spent waiting to write the prewrite Binlog. Delays here can occur if the Binlog service is slow or if there are network issues affecting the communication between TiDB and the Binlog service.\\n\\n### Solutions\\n\\n1. **Optimize PD Performance:**\\n   - Ensure that the PD is not a bottleneck by monitoring its performance and scaling it if necessary. This can involve adding more PD nodes or optimizing the existing PD configuration to handle higher loads.\\n\\n2. **Reduce Network Latency:**\\n   - Co-locate TiDB, TiKV, and PD nodes within the same AZ to minimize network latency. Additionally, ensure that the network infrastructure is optimized for low latency and high throughput.\\n\\n3. **Optimize Binlog Performance:**\\n   - Investigate the Binlog service to ensure it is not a bottleneck. This can involve optimizing the Binlog configuration, ensuring sufficient resources are allocated, and checking for any network issues affecting Binlog communication.\\n\\n4. **Monitor and Analyze Logs:**\\n   - Use TiKV and PD logs to identify any anomalies or errors that could be contributing to the slow transaction commits. Look for patterns or recurring issues that could indicate underlying problems.\\n\\n5. **Use Performance Dashboards:**\\n   - Utilize TiDB's performance dashboards to monitor key metrics such as transaction latency, network latency, and Binlog wait times.

Here's a breakdown of the potential root causes and solutions:\\n\\n### Root Causes\\n\\n1. **Two-Phase Commit Protocol (2PC) Delays**:\\n   - TiDB uses a two-phase commit protocol to ensure atomicity and consistency across distributed nodes. The process involves a prewrite phase and a commit phase, both of which can introduce delays if not optimized.\\n   - The `prewrite` and `commit` phases can be delayed due to network latency, high load on TiKV nodes, or contention on hot regions.\\n\\n2. **Network Latency**:\\n   - High network latency between TiDB and TiKV nodes can significantly impact the time taken for the commit phase. This includes the time to obtain a commit timestamp (`get_commit_ts`) and the time to send and receive RPC requests.\\n   - If the TiDB cluster is deployed across different regions or availability zones, the network latency can be higher, affecting the overall transaction commit time.\\n\\n3. **Configuration Parameters**:\\n   - Suboptimal configuration of TiDB and TiKV parameters can lead to inefficient handling of transactions. For example, parameters related to concurrency, batch sizes, and thread pools need to be tuned according to the workload.\\n   - The `tidb_enable_async_commit` and `tidb_enable_1pc` settings can be adjusted to optimize the commit process. Enabling async commit and one-phase commit can reduce the latency for certain transactions.\\n\\n4. **Contention and Hotspots**:\\n   - Transaction contention, especially in hot regions, can lead to increased wait times during the commit phase. This is often indicated by high `tikv_scheduler_latch_wait_duration_seconds_sum` metrics.\\n   - Hotspots can be mitigated by using features like `SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS` and `AUTO_RANDOM` to distribute the load more evenly across regions.\\n\\n### Solutions\\n\\n1. **Optimize 2PC Configuration**:\\n   - Enable `tidb_enable_async_commit` and `tidb_enable_1pc` to reduce the overhead of the two-phase commit process for transactions that can benefit from these optimizations.\\n   - Adjust TiDB and TiKV configuration parameters such as `performance.max-procs`, `tikv-client.max-batch-wait-time`, and `readpool.unified.max-thread-count` to better handle the workload.\\n\\n2. **Reduce Network Latency**:\\n   - Ensure that TiDB and TiKV nodes are deployed in the same region or availability zone to minimize network latency.\\n   - Use high-speed network interfaces (e.g., 10 gigabit) to ensure fast data transmission between nodes.\\n\\n3. **Monitor and Resolve Contention**:\\n   - Use the TiDB Dashboard and Grafana to monitor metrics related to transaction contention and network latency.\\n   - Identify and resolve hotspots by adjusting the schema design or using TiDB features designed to alleviate hotspots.\\n\\n4. **Performance Tuning**:\\n   - Regularly review and adjust the configuration based on the workload patterns and performance metrics.\\n   - Consider using prepared statements and plan caches to reduce the overhead of query compilation and execution.\\n\\nBy addressing these areas, you can mitigate the slow transaction commit issue in TiDB and improve the overall performance of your distributed database system.\", 'reasoning': \"Alright, let's break down how I arrived at the updated plan. The user is experiencing slow transaction commits in TiDB despite fast prewrite operations. The initial plan focused on gathering knowledge about the transaction commit process and related documentation but missed some crucial steps to diagnose the issue effectively.\\n\\nFirst, I considered the suggestions provided. They highlighted the need to retrieve specific metrics and logs related to the commit phase, such as commit timestamps and network latency. This makes sense because the prewrite phase is fast, so the bottleneck must lie elsewhere. Without detailed metrics, it's hard to pinpoint the exact cause.\\n\\nNext, I thought about how to incorporate these metrics into the plan. I decided to add a step using the `vector_search` tool to fetch relevant TiDB metrics documentation. This would help understand what metrics are available and how to interpret them. Then, another step was added to retrieve network latency logs, which could reveal if the network is causing delays.\\n\\nI also realized that the existing `vector_search` step was too broad. By narrowing the query to focus on the commit phase and 2PC optimizations, the retrieved documentation would be more targeted and useful. This change ensures that the information gathered is directly relevant to the problem.\\n\\nAnother consideration was enhancing the analysis step. The original plan used `llm_generate` to synthesize findings but didn't explicitly include the new metrics and logs. I updated the prompt to include these variables, ensuring that the analysis considers all potential causes, such as commit timestamp delays, network issues, and configuration parameters affecting 2PC.\\n\\nFinally, I made sure the plan remains efficient and avoids redundancy. By adding only necessary steps and refining existing ones, the plan becomes more effective without unnecessary complexity. I also ensured that the final answer variable is correctly assigned and that all steps are properly sequenced.\\n\\nIn summary, the key changes were adding steps to gather specific metrics and network logs, refining the vector search to target commit phase issues, and enhancing the analysis to include these new data points.

If the GC process is not optimized or is taking too long, it can delay transaction commits. The GC process involves resolving locks, deleting ranges, and performing GC on each TiKV node. If any of these steps are delayed, it can impact transaction commit times.\\n\\n2. **Two-Phase Commit (2PC) Protocol**:\\n   - TiDB uses a two-phase commit protocol for transactions. The commit phase involves several steps, including prewrite, wait for prewrite binlog, get commit timestamp, and the actual commit. If any of these steps are delayed, it can lead to slow transaction commits. For instance, network latency or high load on TiKV nodes can increase the time taken for these operations.\\n\\n3. **Network Latency**:\\n   - Network latency between TiDB and TiKV nodes can significantly impact the time taken for transaction commits. If the network latency is high, it can delay the communication required for the two-phase commit protocol.\\n\\n4. **Configuration Parameters**:\\n   - Certain configuration parameters can affect the performance of transaction commits. For example, parameters related to the GC process, network settings, and TiKV performance tuning can all play a role. If these parameters are not optimized, they can lead to slow transaction commits.\\n\\n5. **Resource Contention**:\\n   - If there is high contention for resources such as CPU, memory, or disk I/O, it can slow down the transaction commit process. This is especially true if there are many concurrent transactions or if the system is under heavy load.\\n\\n### Solutions\\n\\n1. **Optimize Garbage Collection**:\\n   - Review and optimize the GC settings to ensure that the process is efficient and does not interfere with transaction commits. Consider adjusting the GC life time and ensuring that the GC process is not running too frequently or taking too long.\\n\\n2. **Review Two-Phase Commit Metrics**:\\n   - Analyze the metrics related to the two-phase commit process, such as prewrite time, commit time, and get commit timestamp time. Identify any bottlenecks and optimize the related processes or configurations.\\n\\n3. **Reduce Network Latency**:\\n   - Ensure that the network infrastructure is optimized to reduce latency between TiDB and TiKV nodes. This may involve upgrading network hardware, optimizing network configurations, or ensuring that nodes are located in close proximity to each other.\\n\\n4. **Tune Configuration Parameters**:\\n   - Review and adjust configuration parameters related to transaction processing, GC, and network settings. Ensure that these parameters are set to values that optimize performance for your specific workload and environment.\\n\\n5. **Monitor and Manage Resource Usage**:\\n   - Use monitoring tools to track resource usage and identify any contention issues.

This plan includes prerequisites, AWS-specific configuration details, deployment steps, pre-deployment checks, and post-deployment verification.\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n\\n1. **AWS Account**: Ensure you have an AWS account with sufficient permissions to create and manage resources such as EC2 instances, VPCs, and security groups. Refer to the [AWS CLI installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html) for setting up AWS CLI.\\n\\n2. **IAM Permissions**: Your AWS account should have the necessary IAM permissions. You need at least the minimum privileges required by `eksctl` and the service privileges needed to create a Linux bastion host. More information on IAM policies can be found [here](https://eksctl.io/usage/minimum-iam-policies/).\\n\\n3. **SSH Key Management**: Generate an SSH key pair if you don't have one. This key pair will be used to access your EC2 instances. You can create a key pair using the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.\\n\\n4. **Security Group Configurations**: Create security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to your EC2 instances. Open the necessary ports for TiDB components, such as 4000 for TiDB, 2379 for PD, and 20160 for TiKV.\\n\\n5. **VPC Setup**: Set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to host your TiDB cluster. This involves creating subnets, route tables, and internet gateways. Ensure that your VPC is configured to allow communication between the TiDB components and external access if needed.\\n\\n6. **Subnet Planning**: Plan your subnets to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Create multiple subnets across different availability zones within your VPC.\\n\\n### AWS-Specific Configuration\\n\\n- **Instance Types**: Use appropriate instance types for different TiDB components. For example, `c7g.xlarge` for PD nodes, `c7g.4xlarge` for TiDB nodes, and `m7g.4xlarge` for TiKV or TiFlash nodes.\\n- **Storage**: Use EBS `gp3` for storage, with recommended provisioning for TiKV and TiFlash nodes.\\n\\n### Deployment Steps\\n\\n1. **Install TiUP**: On your control machine, install TiUP by running the following command:\\n\\n   ```shell\\n   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://tiup-mirrors.pingcap.com/install.sh | sh\\n   ```\\n\\n   After installation, add TiUP to your PATH by opening a new terminal or running `source ~/.bashrc`.\\n\\n2. **Deploy TiUP Cluster Component**: Install the TiUP cluster component:\\n\\n   ```shell\\n   tiup cluster\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Initialize Cluster Topology**: Create a topology file that defines your cluster configuration, including the roles and IP addresses of each node.\\n\\n4. **Run Deployment Command**: Deploy the TiDB cluster using the following command:\\n\\n   ```shell\\n   tiup cluster deploy tidb-test v8.4.0 ./topology.yaml --user root [-p] [-i /home/root/.ssh/gcp_rsa]\\n   ```\\n\\n   - `tidb-test` is the name of the TiDB cluster.\\n   - `v8.4.0` is the version of the TiDB cluster.\\n   - `topology.yaml` is the initialization configuration file.\\n\\n### Pre-Deployment Checks\\n\\n- **Check for Potential Risks**: Use the `check` command to detect potential risks:\\n\\n  ```shell\\n  tiup cluster check ./topology.yaml --user root [-p] [-i /home/root/.ssh/gcp_rsa]\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Enable Automatic Repair**: Use the `check --apply` command to automatically repair potential risks:\\n\\n  ```shell\\n  tiup cluster check ./topology.yaml --apply --user root [-p] [-i /home/root/.ssh/gcp_rsa]\\n  ```\\n\\n### Post-Deployment Verification\\n\\n1. **Check Cluster Status**: Verify the status of the deployed TiDB cluster:\\n\\n   ```shell\\n   tiup cluster display tidb-test\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Start the TiDB Cluster**: Use the safe start method to start the cluster:\\n\\n   ```shell\\n   tiup cluster start tidb-test --init\\n   ```\\n\\n   Record the generated root password for future logins.\\n\\n3. **Verify Running Status**: Ensure the cluster is running properly by checking the status:\\n\\n   ```shell\\n   tiup cluster display tidb-test\\n   ```\\n\\nFor more detailed instructions, refer to the official documentation on deploying a TiDB cluster using TiUP [here](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/production-deployment-using-tiup).\", 'reasoning': \"Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step.

It is compatible with MySQL, offering horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and high availability. TiDB aims to provide a comprehensive database solution that encompasses Online Transactional Processing (OLTP), Online Analytical Processing (OLAP), and HTAP services. This makes TiDB suitable for various use cases that require high availability and strong consistency with large-scale data. [Learn more](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview).\\n\\n## Key Features\\n\\n1. **Horizontal Scalability**: TiDB's architecture separates computing from storage, allowing for easy horizontal scaling. Users can scale out or scale in the computing or storage capacity online as needed, without disrupting application operations. This feature is particularly beneficial for applications experiencing rapid growth in data volume or user demand. [Learn more](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview).\\n\\n2. **High Availability and Strong Consistency**: TiDB ensures financial-grade high availability by storing data in multiple replicas and using the Multi-Raft protocol to manage transaction logs. A transaction is only committed when data is successfully written to the majority of replicas, ensuring strong consistency even if some replicas fail. [Learn more](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview).\\n\\n3. **Real-time HTAP**: TiDB supports real-time HTAP by integrating two storage engines: TiKV, a row-based storage engine, and TiFlash, a columnar storage engine. TiFlash replicates data from TiKV in real time, ensuring data consistency between the two engines. This setup allows TiDB to handle both online transactional processing and real-time data analysis efficiently. [Learn more](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview).\\n\\n4. **Cloud-native Design**: TiDB is designed for cloud environments, offering flexible scalability, reliability, and security.

[Learn more about TiDB\\'s architecture](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview).\\n\\n### High Availability and Consistency\\n\\nTiDB ensures data is stored in multiple replicas using the Multi-Raft protocol. A transaction is only committed when data has been successfully written into the majority of replicas, guaranteeing strong consistency and availability even if some replicas fail. This feature is particularly beneficial for financial industry scenarios where data consistency and reliability are critical. [Explore TiDB\\'s high availability features](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview).\\n\\n### Real-time HTAP\\n\\nTiDB integrates two storage engines: TiKV, a row-based storage engine, and TiFlash, a columnar storage engine. TiFlash replicates data from TiKV in real time, ensuring consistent data between the two engines. This setup allows TiDB to handle both transactional and analytical workloads efficiently, making it suitable for scenarios requiring real-time data processing. [Read more about TiDB\\'s HTAP capabilities](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview).\\n\\n### Cloud-Native Design\\n\\nTiDB is designed for cloud environments, providing flexible scalability, reliability, and security. It supports deployment across different cloud availability zones, ensuring resilience against data center outages. TiDB Operator facilitates managing TiDB on Kubernetes, automating tasks related to operating the TiDB cluster. [Discover TiDB\\'s cloud-native features](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview).\\n\\n### MySQL Compatibility\\n\\nTiDB is compatible with the MySQL protocol and ecosystem, allowing for easy migration of applications without significant code changes. It supports most MySQL syntax and features, although there are some exceptions, such as the lack of support for triggers and stored procedures. [Check TiDB\\'s compatibility with MySQL](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-faq).\\n\\n## Technical Details\\n\\n### TiDB Architecture\\n\\nTiDB\\'s architecture is composed of several key components:\\n\\n- **TiDB Server**: The stateless SQL layer that handles SQL parsing, optimization, and execution. It translates SQL statements into key-value operations and interacts with the storage layer to retrieve and process data.\\n- **TiKV**: A distributed key-value storage engine responsible for data persistence and providing transactional support at the key-value level.\\n- **Placement Driver (PD)**: The cluster manager responsible for metadata management, scheduling, and load balancing.\\n- **TiFlash**: A columnar storage engine designed to accelerate analytical processing, working alongside TiKV to provide real-time HTAP capabilities.\\n\\n![TiDB Architecture](https://download.pingcap.com/images/docs/tidb-architecture-v6.png)\\n\\n## Configurations\\n\\nTiDB configurations can be managed through command-line options, environment variables, and configuration files. These settings control various aspects of TiDB\\'s operation, including logging, query execution, connections, and DDL handling. Configurations can be dynamically modified using system variables and SQL statements without restarting the cluster components.\\n\\n### Example Configuration Files\\n\\n**TiDB Configuration:**\\n\\n```yaml\\nlog.level: \"error\"\\nperformance.max-procs: 20\\nprepared-plan-cache.enabled: true\\ntikv-client.max-batch-wait-time: 2000000\\n```\\n\\n**TiKV Configuration:**\\n\\n```yaml\\nstorage.scheduler-worker-pool-size: 5\\nraftstore.store-pool-size: 3\\nraftstore.apply-pool-size: 3\\nrocksdb.max-background-jobs: 8\\nraftdb.max-background-jobs: 4\\nraftdb.allow-concurrent-memtable-write: true\\nserver.grpc-concurrency: 6\\nreadpool.unified.min-thread-count: 5\\nreadpool.unified.max-thread-count: 20\\nreadpool.storage.normal-concurrency: 10\\npessimistic-txn.pipelined: true\\nserver.enable-request-batch: false\\n```\\n\\n### Recommended Settings\\n\\n- **Logging**: Set `log.level` to `\"error\"` to minimize log verbosity unless debugging is required.\\n- **Concurrency**: Adjust `performance.max-procs` to match the number of CPU cores available to optimize processing power.\\n- **Prepared Plan Cache**: Enable `prepared-plan-cache.enabled` to improve query performance by caching execution plans.\\n\\n### Dynamic Configuration\\n\\nTiDB allows certain configurations to be modified dynamically using SQL statements. For example, to change the slow log threshold:\\n\\n```sql\\nset tidb_slow_log_threshold = 200;\\n```\\n\\n## Use Cases\\n\\n### Financial Industry\\n\\nTiDB is ideal for financial applications that demand high data consistency, reliability, and disaster tolerance. It efficiently manages data across different data centers, ensuring minimal recovery time and zero data loss.\\n\\n### Massive Data and High Concurrency\\n\\nTiDB\\'s architecture supports massive data volumes and high concurrency, making it a cost-effective solution for applications with large-scale data needs.\\n\\n### Real-time Data Processing\\n\\nWith its HTAP capabilities, TiDB is well-suited for scenarios requiring real-time data processing and analysis, combining transactional and analytical workloads in a single system.\\n\\n### Data Aggregation and Processing\\n\\nTiDB simplifies the aggregation and processing of scattered data, enabling the generation of timely reports with ease.\\n\\n## Reference Links\\n\\nFor further details on TiDB\\'s architecture and features, you can explore the following resources:\\n\\n- [TiDB Architecture](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/tidb-architecture)\\n- [TiDB Computing](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/tidb-computing)\\n- [TiDB Storage](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/tidb-storage)\\n- [TiDB Scheduling](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/tidb-scheduling)\\n- [TiDB Self-Managed Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/overview)\\n\\nThese resources provide comprehensive information on TiDB\\'s design, capabilities, and deployment options, helping you understand how to leverage TiDB for your database needs.', 'reasoning': \"Okay, so I need to update the plan for creating a detailed wiki page for TiDB based on the suggestions provided. Let me start by understanding the current plan and the suggestions.\\n\\nThe current plan has several steps where each aspect of TiDB (purpose, features, etc.) is researched using both knowledge graph and vector search, then synthesized into explanations. Finally, all these explanations are compiled into a wiki page.\\n\\nThe suggestions mention adding a review step, enhancing prompts, improving the reasoning process, and adding a validation step for links. I need to incorporate these into the plan.\\n\\nFirst, I'll consider the review step. This should check for formatting, style, and structural consistency. Maybe after compiling the wiki page, I can add a step where the llm_generate tool reviews and adjusts the text according to wiki guidelines.\\n\\nNext, modifying the prompts to include more details like references and examples. I can update each llm_generate prompt to ask for richer content, ensuring each section is comprehensive.\\n\\nFor the reasoning process, I should enhance the context given to the LLM in the final compilation step, instructing it to ensure the page is easy to navigate and follows best practices.\\n\\nAdding a validation step for external links makes sense. I can use llm_generate to check and adjust the links for accuracy and placement.\\n\\nNow, looking at the current plan, I need to insert these changes without altering the initial steps up to seq_no 0. So, I'll add new steps after the final compilation.\\n\\nI'll add a step where the compiled wiki page is reviewed for formatting and style. Then, another step to validate and adjust external links.

'要从TiCDC收集性能配置文件信息，可以使用`curl`命令与TiCDC的pprof接口进行交互。以下是详细的指南，帮助您了解如何使用`curl`命令来获取这些信息。\\n\\n### 1. 访问pprof接口\\n\\nTiCDC提供了一个pprof接口，用于收集性能配置文件信息。默认情况下，pprof接口监听在TiCDC服务的IP和端口上，通常是`http://<TiCDC_IP>:<PORT>/debug/pprof/`。您可以通过以下命令访问pprof接口：\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl http://<TiCDC_IP>:<PORT>/debug/pprof/\\n```\\n\\n### 2. 调整采集时长\\n\\npprof接口允许您指定采集性能数据的时长。默认的采集时长为30秒，但您可以通过在URL中添加`?seconds=<duration>`参数来调整。例如，要将采集时长设置为60秒，可以使用以下命令：\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl http://<TiCDC_IP>:<PORT>/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=60\\n```\\n\\n### 3. 保存数据到文件\\n\\n为了分析性能数据，您可能需要将其保存到文件中。可以使用`curl`的`-o`选项将输出重定向到文件。例如，将性能数据保存到`profile.out`文件中：\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl http://<TiCDC_IP>:<PORT>/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=60 -o profile.out\\n```\\n\\n### 4. 身份验证参数\\n\\n如果您的TiCDC服务启用了身份验证，您需要在`curl`命令中包含身份验证参数。假设使用基本身份验证，您可以通过`-u`选项提供用户名和密码：\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl -u <username>:<password> http://<TiCDC_IP>:<PORT>/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=60 -o profile.out\\n```\\n\\n### 参考链接\\n\\n有关更多详细信息，您可以访问TiCDC的官方文档：[TiCDC Performance Tuning Methods](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/ticdc-performance-tuning-methods)。\\n\\n通过以上步骤，您可以使用`curl`命令从TiCDC收集性能配置文件信息，并根据需要调整采集时长、保存数据到文件以及进行身份验证。', 'reasoning':

The user is facing an issue where the TiFlash component of their TiDB cluster fails to start because the CPU doesn't support the required AVX2, POPCNT, and MOVBE instructions. The error message is clear, so the first thing I need to do is understand the root cause and possible solutions.\\n\\nI know that TiFlash relies heavily on these CPU flags for performance, so without them, it can't function properly. The initial plan involves checking TiFlash's CPU requirements and looking for documentation on compatibility issues. But the user's suggestions point out that there might be more to explore. They want to know if there are any software workarounds or alternative configurations that can bypass the need for these flags, in addition to the hardware upgrade option.\\n\\nSo, I need to incorporate these suggestions into the plan. First, I should add a step to check if there are any configuration options or settings in TiFlash that can disable the CPU flag checks. Maybe there's an option to run TiFlash in a mode that doesn't require these flags. If such an option exists, it could provide a quick fix without needing new hardware.\\n\\nNext, the user also suggested adding a method to verify the current CPU's capabilities. This is crucial because without knowing whether the CPU actually lacks these flags, the solution might be misdirected. I can use a tool like `cpuid` or a similar utility to check the CPU's supported instructions.

This compatibility ensures that many MySQL applications can transition to TiDB with minimal changes, leveraging several key aspects:\\n\\n1. **Protocol Compatibility**: TiDB maintains high compatibility with the MySQL protocol, which means that applications using MySQL can interact with TiDB using the same communication protocols. This compatibility extends to most MySQL drivers and ORM frameworks, allowing them to work seamlessly with TiDB. This is particularly beneficial for applications that rely on MySQL's client-server communication model, as they can continue to function without modification when connected to TiDB.\\n\\n2. **SQL Syntax Alignment**: TiDB supports most MySQL syntax and features, which means that SQL queries written for MySQL can often be executed in TiDB without modification. This includes support for common SQL operations and functions, making it easier for developers to migrate their applications without needing to rewrite SQL code extensively. However, there are some differences and limitations, such as unsupported features like FULLTEXT, HASH, and SPATIAL indexes, which developers should be aware of during migration [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/mysql-compatibility).\\n\\n3. **Authentication Methods**: While TiDB supports many of the same authentication methods as MySQL, there are some differences, particularly with methods specific to MariaDB. It is important to verify the authentication methods used in the existing MySQL setup and ensure they are supported by TiDB. If not, adjustments such as creating new password hashes may be necessary [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/migrate-from-mariadb).\\n\\n4. **Data Type Discrepancies**: TiDB supports most MySQL data types, but there are exceptions. For instance, certain data types like `UUID`, `INET4`, and `INET6` supported by MariaDB are not supported by TiDB. It is crucial to review the data types used in the existing MySQL database and make necessary adjustments to ensure compatibility with TiDB [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/migrate-from-mariadb).\\n\\n5. **Configuration Concerns**: Default configurations in TiDB may differ from those in MySQL. For example, TiDB uses `utf8mb4` as the default character set, whereas MySQL 5.7 defaults to `latin1`. Such differences can affect how data is stored and retrieved, so it is important to align these settings during migration to avoid unexpected behavior [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/mysql-compatibility).\\n\\n6. **Migration Considerations**: When migrating, it is important to consider the size of the dataset and the need for incremental data replication. TiDB provides tools like TiDB Lightning for fast data import and TiDB Data Migration (DM) for replicating binlogs from MySQL, which can help reduce downtime during migration [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/migration-overview).\\n\\nBy addressing these aspects, TiDB ensures a smoother transition for applications migrating from MySQL, allowing them to benefit from TiDB's distributed architecture and scalability while maintaining operational continuity.\", 'reasoning': None, 'plan': [{'parameters': {'output_vars': ['mysql_protocol_compatibility_knowledge'], 'tool_name': 'retrieve_knowledge_graph', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB MySQL protocol compatibility'}}, 'seq_no': 0, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['mysql_protocol_compatibility_details'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': \"How does TiDB's compatibility with MySQL protocol facilitate migration?\", 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 1, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['migration_nuances_details'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'What are the potential migration nuances when moving from MySQL to TiDB?', 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 2, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['synthesized_explanation'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': 'Knowledge Graph Data: ${mysql_protocol_compatibility_knowledge}\\nVector Search Data: ${mysql_protocol_compatibility_details}\\nMigration Nuances: ${migration_nuances_details}', 'prompt': \"Using the information from the knowledge graph, vector search results, and migration nuances, explain how TiDB's compatibility with the MySQL protocol facilitates easier migration for existing MySQL applications.

[Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/mysql-compatibility)\\n\\n- **SQL Syntax Alignment**:\\n  - TiDB extends MySQL syntax with additional statements like `SHOW BUILTINS` and `ADMIN`, which are specific to TiDB. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sql-statement-show-builtins)\\n  - Some MySQL features are not supported in TiDB, including stored procedures, triggers, events, user-defined functions, and certain syntaxes like `FULLTEXT` and `SPATIAL`. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/mysql-compatibility)\\n\\n- **Authentication Methods**:\\n  - TiDB supports security features similar to MySQL 5.7 and some features of MySQL 8.0, but the implementation differs. TiDB does not support certain MySQL security features, such as column-level permissions and multi-factor authentication. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/security-compatibility-with-mysql)\\n\\n- **Data Type Discrepancies**:\\n  - TiDB does not support certain MySQL column types, such as `SQL_TSI_*` (excluding `SQL_TSI_YEAR`), and some data types available in MariaDB, such as `UUID`, `INET4`, and `INET6`.

Let me go through this step by step. \\n\\nFirst, the original plan has five steps. The first step (seq_no 0) retrieves knowledge from the knowledge graph about TiDB's MySQL protocol compatibility. The second step (seq_no 1) uses vector search to get details on how this compatibility facilitates migration. The third step (seq_no 2) looks into potential migration nuances. Then, step four synthesizes all this information, and the final step assigns the result as the final answer.\\n\\nThe suggestions mention that the remaining steps could be improved. Specifically, adding an explicit summarization step for each migration factor, using more targeted vector search queries, and incorporating additional best practices. The goal is to make the explanation more detailed and structured.\\n\\nSo, I need to modify the plan starting from the current program counter, which is step 1. I should keep all steps up to and including step 0 unchanged.\\n\\nLet me think about how to incorporate the suggestions. The first change is to add more targeted vector search queries for each migration factor: protocol compatibility, SQL syntax, authentication, data types, configuration, and other considerations. This means adding separate vector_search calls for each of these areas.\\n\\nNext, after retrieving all this information, I should summarize each factor individually. This can be done by using the llm_generate tool to create bullet points for each category. Then, another llm_generate step can synthesize these points into a coherent explanation.\\n\\nAdditionally, including a step to gather migration best practices would add more value. This can be another vector_search call followed by an llm_generate step to summarize the best practices.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that the final answer is comprehensive and structured, possibly using bullet points for clarity. \\n\\nLet me outline the steps I need to add:\\n\\n1. After the initial vector_search in step 1, add more vector_search steps for each migration factor.\\n2. Use llm_generate to summarize each factor into bullet points.\\n3. Synthesize all bullet points into a final explanation.\\n4. Add a step to gather and summarize best practices.\\n5. Ensure that all steps contribute to the final answer without redundancy.\\n\\nI should also make sure that each tool's output is stored in appropriate variables and that the final answer is correctly assigned.\\n\\nNow, considering the plan structure, I'll need to add several new steps after step 1. Each vector_search will target a specific aspect, followed by llm_generate to process the results. Finally, a comprehensive synthesis step will compile all the information.\\n\\nI need to be careful with variable names to avoid conflicts and ensure that each step correctly references the previous outputs. Also, I must maintain the sequence numbers correctly, starting from the current program counter.\\n\\nAnother consideration is the efficiency of the plan. Adding too many steps might slow down execution, but it's necessary for thoroughness.

However, some MySQL features like stored procedures, triggers, and certain data types are not supported in TiDB. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sql-statement-show-builtins) [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/mysql-compatibility)\\n\\n- **Authentication Methods**:\\n  - TiDB supports security features similar to MySQL 5.7 and some from MySQL 8.0, but with different implementations. Some MySQL security features, such as column-level permissions and multi-factor authentication, are not supported in TiDB. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/security-compatibility-with-mysql)\\n\\n- **Data Type Discrepancies**:\\n  - TiDB does not support certain MySQL column types, such as `SQL_TSI_*` (excluding `SQL_TSI_YEAR`). It also uses `utf8mb4` as the default character set, aligning with MySQL 8.0 but differing from MySQL 5.7's default `latin1`. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/mysql-compatibility)\\n\\n- **Configuration Concerns**:\\n  - TiDB has differences in default settings compared to MySQL, such as the default character set and collation, SQL mode, and the handling of `lower_case_table_names`. TiDB supports only `lower_case_table_names=2`, while MySQL varies by operating system. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/mysql-compatibility)\\n\\n- **Migration Nuances**:\\n  - When migrating from MySQL to TiDB, consider compatibility differences, such as unsupported MariaDB-specific features and some MySQL data types. TiDB provides tools like TiDB Lightning for full data migration and TiDB Data Migration (DM) for incremental replication. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/migrate-from-mariadb) [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/migration-overview)\\n\\n- **Best Practices**:\\n  - Choose the right migration strategy based on data size and application needs. Use TiDB Lightning for large datasets and DM for incremental data replication. Ensure good network connectivity and conduct thorough testing before migration. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/migrate-from-mysql-using-data-migration) [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/migration-overview)\\n\\nThese points highlight how TiDB's compatibility with the MySQL protocol facilitates a smoother transition for existing MySQL applications, minimizing unexpected issues and ensuring a more efficient migration process.\", 'reasoning': \"Okay, I need to update the plan based on the suggestions provided. Let me go through this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I look at the original plan. It has several steps, including retrieving knowledge from the knowledge graph and using vector search to get details on how TiDB's MySQL protocol compatibility facilitates migration. Then, it looks into potential migration nuances and synthesizes all this information into a final answer.\\n\\nThe suggestions mention that the remaining steps could be improved. Specifically, adding an explicit summarization step for each migration factor, using more targeted vector search queries, and incorporating additional best practices. The goal is to make the explanation more detailed and structured.\\n\\nI need to modify the plan starting from the current program counter, which is step 1. I should keep all steps up to and including step 0 unchanged.\\n\\nSo, I think about adding more targeted vector search queries for each migration factor: protocol compatibility, SQL syntax, authentication, data types, configuration, and other considerations. This means adding separate vector_search calls for each of these areas.\\n\\nAfter retrieving all this information, I should summarize each factor individually. This can be done by using the llm_generate tool to create bullet points for each category. Then, another llm_generate step can synthesize these points into a coherent explanation.\\n\\nAdditionally, including a step to gather migration best practices would add more value. This can be another vector_search call followed by an llm_generate step to summarize the best practices.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that the final answer is comprehensive and structured, possibly using bullet points for clarity.\\n\\nI outline the steps I need to add:\\n\\n1. After the initial vector_search in step 1, add more vector_search steps for each migration factor.\\n2. Use llm_generate to summarize each factor into bullet points.\\n3. Synthesize all bullet points into a final explanation.\\n4. Add a step to gather and summarize best practices.\\n5. Ensure that all steps contribute to the final answer without redundancy.\\n\\nI need to make sure that each tool's output is stored in appropriate variables and that the final answer is correctly assigned.\\n\\nConsidering the plan structure, I'll need to add several new steps after step 1. Each vector_search will target a specific aspect, followed by llm_generate to process the results. Finally, a comprehensive synthesis step will compile all the information.\\n\\nI also need to be careful with variable names to avoid conflicts and ensure that each step correctly references the previous outputs. Additionally, I must maintain the sequence numbers correctly, starting from the current program counter.\\n\\nAnother consideration is the efficiency of the plan. Adding too many steps might slow down execution, but it's necessary for thoroughness. I'll balance the number of steps to cover all aspects without overwhelming the process.\\n\\nLastly, I'll ensure that the final answer is in English and directly addresses the goal of explaining how TiDB's MySQL compatibility facilitates migration.\", 'plan': [{'parameters': {'output_vars': ['mysql_protocol_compatibility_knowledge'], 'tool_name': 'retrieve_knowledge_graph', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB MySQL protocol compatibility'}}, 'seq_no': 0, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['mysql_protocol_compatibility_details'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': \"How does TiDB's compatibility with MySQL protocol facilitate migration?\", 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 1, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['protocol_details'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB MySQL protocol compatibility details', 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 2, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['syntax_details'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB MySQL syntax compatibility details', 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 3, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['authentication_details'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB MySQL authentication compatibility details', 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 4, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['data_type_details'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB MySQL data type compatibility details', 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 5, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['configuration_details'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB MySQL configuration compatibility details', 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 6, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['migration_nuances_details'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'What are the potential migration nuances when moving from MySQL to TiDB?', 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 7, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['best_practices_details'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'Best practices for migrating from MySQL to TiDB', 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 8, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['protocol_summary'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': '${protocol_details}', 'prompt': \"Summarize the key points about TiDB's MySQL protocol compatibility in bullet points.

Understanding these limitations and the strategies for adapting or replacing them is crucial for developers migrating applications or using TiDB in place of MySQL.\\n\\n### Unsupported MySQL Features in TiDB\\n\\n1. **Indexes**: TiDB does not support certain types of indexes that are available in MySQL, such as `FULLTEXT`, `HASH`, and `SPATIAL` indexes. While TiDB accepts these index types in syntax for compatibility, it ignores them during execution. This means that applications relying on these index types for performance improvements or specific functionalities will need to find alternative solutions or adjust their design to work with TiDB's supported index types.\\n\\n2. **Stored Procedures and Functions**: TiDB does not support stored procedures, triggers, events, or user-defined functions. These features are often used in MySQL for encapsulating business logic within the database. In TiDB, developers may need to move this logic to the application layer or use alternative methods such as scheduled tasks or external scripts to achieve similar functionality.\\n\\n3. **Isolation Levels**: TiDB does not support the `READ-UNCOMMITTED` and `SERIALIZABLE` isolation levels. Instead, it supports `REPEATABLE-READ` and `READ-COMMITTED`. Applications that require the unsupported isolation levels will need to adjust their transaction handling to align with the supported levels in TiDB. For compatibility with applications that set `SERIALIZABLE` but do not depend on it, TiDB provides a system variable `tidb_skip_isolation_level_check` to ignore the unsupported isolation level error.\\n\\n4. **Data Types and Syntax**: Some MySQL data types and syntax are not supported in TiDB. For example, TiDB does not support certain spatial data types and functions, and it has differences in handling certain SQL modes and character sets. Developers need to review their schema and queries to ensure compatibility with TiDB's supported data types and syntax.\\n\\n5. **DDL Operations**: TiDB imposes restrictions on certain DDL operations. For instance, it does not support modifying multiple schema objects in a single `ALTER TABLE` statement if the same object is specified in multiple changes. Additionally, changes to some data types and operations on partitioned tables are restricted. Developers should plan their schema changes accordingly and may need to perform multiple separate operations to achieve the desired schema modifications.\\n\\n### Strategies for Adapting or Replacing Unsupported Features\\n\\n- **Index Alternatives**: For applications that rely on unsupported index types, consider using TiDB's supported index types such as `BTREE` or redesigning queries to optimize performance without those indexes.\\n\\n- **Application Logic**: Move business logic from stored procedures and functions to the application layer. This can be done using application code or external scripts that interact with the database.\\n\\n- **Transaction Handling**: Adjust transaction isolation levels to use `REPEATABLE-READ` or `READ-COMMITTED`, and use the `tidb_skip_isolation_level_check` variable if necessary to maintain compatibility with existing applications.\\n\\n- **Schema and Query Adjustments**: Review and modify schemas and queries to ensure compatibility with TiDB's supported data types and syntax. This may involve changing data types, rewriting queries, or using alternative methods to achieve the same functionality.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on TiDB's compatibility with MySQL and specific unsupported features, you can refer to the following sources:\\n- [MySQL Compatibility](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/mysql-compatibility)\\n- [Third-Party Tools Compatibility](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/dev-guide-third-party-tools-compatibility)\", 'reasoning': 'To address the goal of understanding how TiDB handles unsupported MySQL features like FULLTEXT, HASH, and SPATIAL indexes during migration, we need to create a structured plan.

However, there are strategies and workarounds to handle these unsupported features effectively.\\n\\n### FULLTEXT Indexes\\n\\nFULLTEXT indexes in MySQL are used for full-text search capabilities, allowing for efficient searching of text data. Since TiDB does not support FULLTEXT indexes, users can employ external full-text search engines or libraries to achieve similar functionality. Popular solutions include:\\n\\n- **Elasticsearch**: This is a widely used search engine that can be integrated with TiDB to provide full-text search capabilities. Data from TiDB can be synchronized to Elasticsearch, where complex text queries can be executed.\\n- **Apache Solr**: Another robust search platform that can be used alongside TiDB. Like Elasticsearch, it allows for powerful text searching and can be integrated to handle full-text search requirements.\\n- **Sphinx**: A full-text search engine that can be used as a library or a standalone server. It can be configured to index data from TiDB and provide full-text search capabilities.\\n\\nThese integrations typically involve setting up a data pipeline to keep the search index updated with changes in the TiDB database.\\n\\n### HASH Indexes\\n\\nHASH indexes are ignored in TiDB because the underlying storage engine, TiKV, does not support them. Instead, TiDB uses BTREE indexes, which are more versatile and can handle a wider range of query types. BTREE indexes are particularly effective for range queries, which are not supported by HASH indexes. For scenarios where HASH indexes might be preferred, such as exact match queries, BTREE indexes can still be used effectively, albeit with potentially different performance characteristics.\\n\\n### SPATIAL Indexes\\n\\nSPATIAL indexes are used for geospatial data types and queries. Since TiDB does not support SPATIAL indexes, users can consider the following approaches:\\n\\n- **PostGIS**: This is an extension for PostgreSQL that adds support for geographic objects. While it is not directly compatible with TiDB, users can maintain a separate PostgreSQL instance with PostGIS for handling geospatial queries and synchronize relevant data between TiDB and PostgreSQL.\\n- **Third-party GIS Solutions**: Tools like GeoServer or QGIS can be used to manage and query geospatial data. These tools can be integrated with TiDB to provide spatial data processing capabilities.\\n\\nIn summary, while TiDB does not natively support FULLTEXT, HASH, and SPATIAL indexes, there are effective workarounds and integrations available.

These tools are designed to handle full-text search functionalities efficiently and can be used alongside TiDB to provide the necessary search capabilities.\\n\\n2. **HASH Indexes**: While MySQL supports `HASH` indexes for fast equality searches, TiDB does not. Instead, you can use `BTREE` indexes, which are supported by TiDB. `BTREE` indexes can often serve similar purposes for equality searches, and you may need to restructure your queries to leverage `BTREE` indexes effectively.\\n\\n3. **SPATIAL Indexes**: TiDB does not support `SPATIAL` indexes or GIS functions, which are used for handling spatial data in MySQL. For managing spatial data, consider using a dedicated spatial database like PostGIS. PostGIS is capable of handling complex spatial queries and indexing.

Here’s how TiDB handles these features and the recommended migration strategies:\\n\\n1. **FULLTEXT Indexes**: TiDB does not support FULLTEXT indexes, which are used in MySQL for full-text search capabilities. To adapt, you can integrate external search engines like Elasticsearch or Apache Solr. These tools are designed to handle full-text search efficiently and can be integrated with TiDB to provide similar functionality. This approach not only compensates for the lack of FULLTEXT support but also often results in better performance for complex search queries due to the specialized nature of these search engines.\\n\\n2. **HASH Indexes**: While MySQL supports HASH indexes, TiDB does not. Instead, TiDB uses B-tree indexes by default, which are generally efficient for a wide range of use cases. B-tree indexes are suitable for most query types, especially those involving range queries. If your application specifically requires hash-based indexing, consider implementing application-level hashing logic. This involves manually managing hash keys within your application to simulate the behavior of HASH indexes.\\n\\n3. **SPATIAL Indexes**: TiDB does not support SPATIAL indexes or GIS functions, which are used for geospatial data handling in MySQL. For applications that require geospatial capabilities, consider using a dedicated spatial database like PostGIS. PostGIS can handle spatial queries and indexing efficiently and can be integrated with TiDB to manage geospatial data. This setup allows you to leverage the strengths of both systems: TiDB for general data management and PostGIS for spatial data operations.\\n\\n**Performance Considerations**: When substituting FULLTEXT and SPATIAL indexes with external systems, it's crucial to consider the performance implications. External systems like Elasticsearch and PostGIS are optimized for their respective tasks and can significantly enhance performance for full-text and spatial queries. However, they introduce additional complexity and potential latency due to network communication between systems. It's important to evaluate the trade-offs and ensure that the integration aligns with your application's performance requirements.\\n\\n**Best Practices for Integration**: \\n- Ensure that the external systems are properly configured and optimized for your specific use case.\\n- Use asynchronous data synchronization between TiDB and the external systems to minimize performance impact.\\n- Regularly monitor and maintain the external systems to ensure they continue to meet performance expectations.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on TiDB's compatibility with MySQL and unsupported features, you can refer to the official TiDB documentation: [TiDB MySQL Compatibility](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/dev-guide-third-party-tools-compatibility).\", 'reasoning': \"Alright, I need to update the plan based on the user's suggestions.

These tools are designed to handle large-scale text search efficiently and can be integrated with TiDB to provide similar functionality.\\n   - **Application-Level Search**: Implement full-text search at the application level by retrieving data from TiDB and performing text search operations within the application logic. This approach may not be as efficient as using a dedicated search engine but can be a temporary solution.\\n\\n2. **HASH Indexes**:\\n   - **BTREE Indexes**: TiDB supports BTREE indexes, which can be used as an alternative to HASH indexes for many use cases. While BTREE indexes may not provide the same performance characteristics as HASH indexes for certain operations, they are generally suitable for a wide range of queries.\\n   - **Application Logic**: For specific use cases where HASH indexes are crucial, consider implementing hash-based lookups in the application logic. This involves computing hash values within the application and using them to filter or sort data retrieved from TiDB.\\n\\n3. **SPATIAL Indexes**:\\n   - **Geospatial Libraries**: Use geospatial libraries in your application to handle geographic data types and operations. Libraries such as PostGIS (for PostgreSQL) or GeoTools (for Java) can provide the necessary functionality to work with spatial data.\\n   - **External GIS Systems**: Consider integrating TiDB with an external GIS system that supports SPATIAL indexes and operations.

表记录了当前 TiDB 节点上所有索引的使用统计信息。通过查询此表，您可以获取每个索引的执行次数、扫描的行数、选择性分布以及最近访问时间等信息。这些指标可以帮助您判断索引是否被使用以及使用的频率。\\n\\n#### 示例 SQL 查询\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT \\n    TABLE_SCHEMA, \\n    TABLE_NAME, \\n    INDEX_NAME, \\n    QUERY_COUNT, \\n    ROWS_READ, \\n    LAST_USED_AT \\nFROM \\n    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TIDB_INDEX_USAGE\\nWHERE \\n    QUERY_COUNT = 0;\\n```\\n\\n上述查询将返回自 TiDB 实例启动以来未被使用的索引。`QUERY_COUNT` 为 0 表示该索引未被查询使用。\\n\\n### 使用 `sys.schema_unused_indexes` 视图\\n\\n`sys.schema_unused_indexes` 视图专门用于显示自 TiDB 实例上次启动以来未被使用的索引。对于从早期版本升级的集群，可能需要手动创建此视图。\\n\\n#### 示例 SQL 查询\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM sys.schema_unused_indexes;\\n```\\n\\n此查询将列出所有未被使用的索引，帮助您识别可能需要删除或优化的索引。\\n\\n### 注意事项\\n\\n- **文档版本**：确保您参考的文档版本与您的 TiDB 版本一致，以获取准确的信息。有关 `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TIDB_INDEX_USAGE` 的更多信息，请参阅 [文档](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/information-schema-tidb-index-usage)。有关 `sys.schema_unused_indexes` 的更多信息，请参阅 [文档](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/sys-schema-unused-indexes)。\\n-

8.1版本中索引使用情况的问题。首先，回顾一下当前的计划和执行情况。\\n\\n当前计划分为几个步骤：\\n1. **推理步骤**：分析如何确定TiDB 8.1中索引是否被使用，涉及检索知识图谱和向量搜索，最后生成答案。\\n2. **检索知识图谱**：使用`retrieve_knowledge_graph`工具，查询“TiDB 8.1 索引使用监控功能”。\\n3. **向量搜索**：使用`vector_search`工具，查询“TiDB 8.1 索引性能指标”，返回前3个结果。\\n4. **生成最终答案**：使用`llm_generate`工具，结合知识图谱和向量搜索的结果，生成最终答案。\\n\\n当前程序计数器在第2步，已经执行了第1步和第2步，分别获取了知识图谱中的信息和向量搜索的文档。\\n\\n根据用户的建议，需要改进计划以提高答案的全面性和准确性。具体建议包括：\\n1. 增加对向量搜索返回的性能指标细节的引用，如扫描行数、执行次数、选择性分布等。\\n2. 在生成最终答案前，增加一个总结步骤，将知识图谱和向量搜索的信息统一归纳，确保覆盖所有关键点。\\n3. 提供实际的SQL示例，如查询`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TIDB_INDEX_USAGE`表，帮助用户直观验证索引使用情况。\\n4. 检查是否有新版文档或版本特定的配置和限制，以确保答案在生产环境中的正确性。\\n\\n接下来，我需要评估这些建议，并确定如何将它们融入现有的计划中。\\n\\n首先，建议1和2都涉及整合更多信息到最终答案中。因此，可以考虑在现有步骤之后增加一个总结步骤，使用`llm_generate`工具将知识图谱和向量搜索的信息整合，并生成一个更全面的中间结果。然后，再生成最终答案，确保所有关键点都被覆盖。\\n\\n建议3提到提供SQL示例，这可以通过在总结步骤中加入这些示例来实现，或者在最终答案生成时包含进去。考虑到用户可能需要实际操作步骤，提供具体的SQL查询语句会更有帮助。\\n\\n建议4涉及检查文档版本和配置限制，这可能需要在检索知识图谱和向量搜索时特别注意，或者在总结步骤中提及。然而，当前工具可能无法直接获取这些信息，因此可能需要在最终答案中提醒用户查阅最新文档或配置说明。\\n\\n现在，考虑如何在现有计划中加入这些改进。由于当前程序计数器在第2步，已经执行了知识图谱检索和向量搜索，接下来的步骤需要处理这些信息。\\n\\n因此，可以在现有步骤之后插入一个新的`calling`步骤，使用`llm_generate`工具来总结和整合知识图谱和向量搜索的结果，生成一个中间变量`summary_info`。然后，再使用另一个`calling`步骤，结合这个总结信息和提供的SQL示例，生成最终答案。\\n\\n这样，计划的结构将变为：\\n1. 知识图谱检索（已执行）\\n2. 向量搜索（已执行）\\n3. 总结步骤，整合信息到`summary_info`\\n4. 生成最终答案，结合`summary_info`和SQL示例\\n\\n同时，确保在生成最终答案时，语言保持中文，并且涵盖所有建议的改进点。\\n\\n最后，检查变量引用，确保所有变量在生成步骤中可用，并且不会引用已被垃圾回收的变量。\\n\\n综上所述，更新后的计划将包括新增的总结步骤和改进的最终答案生成步骤，以提高答案的质量和实用性。', 'plan': [{'parameters':

监控和日志\\n\\nTiDB 提供了一些系统表和日志来帮助监控索引的使用情况：\\n\\n1. **慢查询日志**:\\n   TiDB 会记录慢查询日志，其中包含了查询的执行计划。你可以通过查看慢查询日志来分析索引的使用情况。\\n\\n2. **系统表**:\\n   - `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.INSPECTION_RESULT`: 可以用来检查集群的健康状况，包括索引的使用情况。\\n   - `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SLOW_QUERY`: 包含慢查询的详细信息，可以帮助你分析哪些查询没有有效利用索引。\\n\\n### 优化建议\\n\\n- **创建合适的索引**: 如果发现某些查询没有使用索引，可以考虑为相关列创建索引。\\n- **分析查询模式**: 通过 `EXPLAIN` 分析查询模式，调整查询以更好地利用现有索引。\\n- **定期检查**: 定期使用 `EXPLAIN` 和慢查询日志来检查索引的使用情况，确保数据库性能的持续优化。\\n\\n通过这些方法，你可以有效地监控和优化 TiDB 中索引的使用情况，提高查询性能。\\n\\n有关更多详细信息和具体操作步骤，可以参考以下文档：\\n- [TiDB 8.1.0 Release

在任何 `SELECT` 语句前加上 `EXPLAIN` 来查看其执行计划。\\n\\n   ```sql\\n   EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE your_column = \\'some_value\\';\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **查看执行计划**: 执行上述命令后，TiDB 会返回一个表格，显示查询的执行计划。关键字段包括：\\n\\n   - `id`: 执行计划中每个操作的标识符。\\n   - `estRows`: 估计的返回行数。\\n   - `task`: 执行任务的类型（如 `root`、`cop`）。\\n   - `access object`: 访问的对象（如表或索引）。\\n   - `operator info`: 操作的详细信息，通常会显示使用了哪个索引。\\n\\n3. **判断索引使用**: 在 `operator info` 列中，如果显示了 `IndexRangeScan` 或 `IndexLookUp`，则表示查询使用了索引。`TableFullScan` 则表示没有使用索引。\\n\\n#### 示例：\\n\\n假设我们有一个表 `users`，其中有一个索引 `idx_name` 在 `name` 列上。我们希望查询 `name` 为 `\\'Alice\\'` 的用户，并查看索引的使用情况。\\n\\n```sql\\n-- 创建示例表\\nCREATE TABLE users (\\n    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\\n    name VARCHAR(100),\\n    age INT,\\n    INDEX idx_name (name)\\n);\\n\\n-- 使用 EXPLAIN 查看查询计划\\nEXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = \\'Alice\\';\\n```\\n\\n执行上述 `EXPLAIN` 语句后，假设返回的结果如下：\\n\\n```\\n+-------------------+----------+-----------+-----------------+--------------------------------+\\n| id                | estRows  | task      | access object   | operator info

本身不直接提供索引使用的日志，但可以通过以下方式间接监控：\\n\\n1. **慢查询日志**: 配置 TiDB 的慢查询日志，记录执行时间超过某个阈值的查询。通过分析慢查询日志，可以发现哪些查询没有使用索引。\\n\\n2. **性能监控工具**: 使用 TiDB Dashboard 或其他监控工具，查看查询的执行计划和性能指标。\\n\\n3. **定期分析**: 定期使用 `EXPLAIN` 分析关键查询，确保它们使用了合适的索引。\\n\\n通过这些方法，你可以有效地监控和优化 TiDB 中的索引使用情况。更多关于 TiDB 8.1 的信息可以参考 [TiDB 8.1.0 Release Notes](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-8.1.0) 和 [TiDB 8.1.1 Release

8.1中新引入的系统视图（如INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TIDB_INDEX_USAGE和sys.schema_unused_indexes）的查询，这些视图可以提供更详细的索引使用统计信息。因此，我决定在检索知识图谱的步骤中增加这些查询，以获取更多相关数据。\\n\\n然后，我评估了现有的检索步骤，发现需要进一步确认这些新监控功能的使用方法和示例。因此，我在计划中增加了检索官方文档的步骤，以确保引用的信息是最新的，并提供如何利用TiDB Dashboard查看索引使用统计数据的说明。\\n\\n最后，我考虑了如何在最终的LLM生成步骤中整合这些新检索到的数据。我决定在生成最终答案时，将EXPLAIN命令的输出与新系统视图的数据结合起来，给出一个完整的操作指南，并明确列出哪些指标或日志记录可以帮助判断索引是否正在被使用。这将使最终答案在逻辑和数据上更加充分和全面。\\n\\n在更新计划时，我确保所有步骤都符合VM的规范，变量引用正确，并且没有引入冗余或不必要的复杂性。此外，我保持了原有的步骤顺序，只在适当的位置添加了新的步骤，以确保计划的连贯性和效率。\\n\\n通过这些建议的实施，最终的计划将能够更好地满足用户的需求，提供更全面和详细的信息，帮助他们确定TiDB

Let me first understand what the current plan does and where it can be improved.\\n\\nThe current plan is designed to explain how TiDB Serverless' HTAP architecture contributes to cost savings compared to MySQL RDS. It involves several steps: searching for information about TiDB's HTAP architecture, retrieving knowledge graphs, summarizing the information, and then doing the same for MySQL RDS. After that, it looks into cost-saving features of TiDB's HTAP and finally synthesizes all this into a final answer.\\n\\nThe suggestions mention that the plan could be improved by adding explicit queries for quantitative cost metrics, performance benchmarks, or real-world case studies. They also suggest modifying the prompts to extract numerical data and empirical evidence, which would strengthen the reasoning. Additionally, the prompts should be streamlined to highlight how TiDB's design reduces costs compared to MySQL RDS.\\n\\nSo, I need to incorporate these suggestions into the plan. Let me go through each step of the current plan and see where I can add new steps or modify existing ones.\\n\\nFirst, the plan starts with vector_search and retrieve_knowledge_graph for TiDB's HTAP.

Here’s how it contributes to cost savings:\\n\\n1. **Unified System for OLTP and OLAP**: TiDB Serverless combines Online Transactional Processing (OLTP) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) capabilities in one platform. This eliminates the need for separate databases for transactional and analytical tasks, thereby reducing infrastructure and maintenance costs associated with managing multiple systems.\\n\\n2. **Automatic Data Replication and Consistency**: The architecture uses TiKV for transactional workloads and TiFlash for analytical workloads, with automatic data replication and strong consistency ensured by the Raft consensus algorithm. This setup reduces the complexity and cost of data synchronization processes, ensuring that analytical queries are performed on the most current data without additional overhead.\\n\\n3. **Simplified ETL Processes**: By integrating transactional and analytical processing, TiDB HTAP simplifies the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes. This reduces the complexity and cost of maintaining multiple systems and processes for data transformation and loading, which is often necessary in traditional setups.\\n\\n4. **Cost Optimization in Query Execution**: TiDB automatically chooses between TiKV and TiFlash for query execution based on cost optimization. This ensures that queries are executed efficiently, reducing computational costs and improving performance.\\n\\n5. **Scalability and Resource Utilization**: The architecture allows for separate scaling of computing and storage resources, enabling organizations to optimize resource utilization. This flexibility allows for cost-effective scaling as data and workload requirements grow, unlike traditional systems that may require over-provisioning.\\n\\n6. **Real-time Analytics on Operational Data**: TiDB provides real-time insights from transactional data without the need for separate data warehousing solutions. This capability reduces the need for additional infrastructure and associated costs for real-time data analysis.\\n\\n7. **Reduced DevOps Costs**: The ability of TiDB HTAP to handle large data volumes and high concurrency reduces the operational costs associated with managing and maintaining separate systems for transactional and analytical workloads.\\n\\nIn contrast, MySQL RDS typically requires separate systems or additional services for analytical processing, which can increase costs related to infrastructure, data synchronization, and maintenance.

This eliminates the need for separate databases for transactional and analytical workloads, reducing infrastructure costs and simplifying data management. In contrast, MySQL RDS typically requires integration with additional services for analytics, which can increase costs.\\n\\n2. **Real-Time Analytics Without Separate Data Warehousing**: TiDB's HTAP architecture allows for real-time analytics on transactional data without the need for separate data warehousing solutions. This reduces the complexity and cost associated with maintaining multiple systems. MySQL RDS, on the other hand, often requires data migration to analytics platforms, incurring additional costs for data transfer and integration.\\n\\n3. **Automatic Resource Optimization**: TiDB Cloud Serverless provides a fully managed, auto-scaling deployment that adjusts resources based on workload demands. This leads to cost savings by optimizing resource usage and eliminating the need for manual infrastructure management. MySQL RDS charges are based on instance type, storage, and data transfer, which may not automatically scale with workload demands.\\n\\n4. **Cost Optimization in Query Execution**: TiDB employs cost optimization to decide whether to execute queries using TiKV or TiFlash, ensuring efficient resource usage and reducing operational costs. This is particularly beneficial for complex analytical queries, which are handled more efficiently by TiFlash's Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) engine.\\n\\n5. **Simplified ETL Processes**: By supporting both OLTP and OLAP workloads, TiDB HTAP simplifies the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, reducing the need for multiple technology stacks and minimizing the complexity and cost associated with maintaining separate systems.\\n\\n6. **Scalability and Flexibility**: TiDB's architecture allows for easy scaling of both computing and storage resources, enabling businesses to scale their infrastructure according to their needs without incurring unnecessary costs. This flexibility is particularly advantageous for businesses with fluctuating workloads.\\n\\n7. **Empirical Evidence and Performance Metrics**: Performance benchmarks, such as the Sysbench and TPC-C tests, demonstrate TiDB's strong performance in both transactional and analytical processing. For example, TiDB achieved a QPS (Queries Per Second) of up to 489,988.97 with a 95% latency of 5.47 ms on a c2-standard-16 machine type. These metrics highlight TiDB's efficiency and potential for cost savings in high-performance environments.\\n\\n8. **Real-World Case Studies**: Real-world case studies show that TiDB's HTAP architecture can handle complex workloads efficiently, making it a compelling choice for businesses that require both transactional and analytical capabilities. This efficiency translates into cost savings by reducing the need for multiple database systems and optimizing resource usage.\\n\\nIn summary, TiDB Serverless offers significant cost-saving advantages through its unified HTAP architecture, real-time analytics capabilities, automatic resource optimization, and simplified data management processes.

Here’s a detailed breakdown:\\n\\n### Infrastructure Overhead\\n\\n**TiDB Serverless HTAP:**\\n- **Unified System for OLTP and OLAP:** TiDB integrates both transactional and analytical processing within a single system, eliminating the need for separate databases for OLTP and OLAP tasks. This consolidation reduces infrastructure overhead by minimizing the number of systems that need to be deployed and maintained.\\n- **Real-time Data Processing:** The ability to process data in real-time without separate data warehousing solutions further reduces infrastructure needs and associated costs.\\n\\n**MySQL RDS:**\\n- **Separate Systems for OLTP and OLAP:** Typically requires separate systems or additional tools for analytical processing, increasing infrastructure complexity and costs.\\n- **High-Availability Configurations:** While MySQL RDS offers Multi-AZ deployments for high availability, this can increase costs due to the need for additional resources across multiple availability zones.\\n\\n### Maintenance Costs\\n\\n**TiDB Serverless HTAP:**\\n- **Simplified Technology Stack:** By combining OLTP, ETL, and OLAP capabilities, TiDB reduces the complexity of the technology stack, leading to lower maintenance costs. Fewer systems mean less need for extensive DevOps resources.\\n- **Managed and Auto-Scaling:** TiDB Cloud Serverless is fully managed and automatically scales resources based on workload demands, reducing the need for manual intervention and ongoing maintenance.\\n\\n**MySQL RDS:**\\n- **Manual Configuration for Features:** Features like GTID require manual setup and instance restarts, which can increase maintenance efforts and potential downtime.\\n- **Migration Complexity:** Data migration using AWS DMS involves setting up replication instances and configuring endpoints, which can be resource-intensive.\\n\\n### Query Efficiency\\n\\n**TiDB Serverless HTAP:**\\n- **Cost Optimization in Query Execution:** TiDB automatically selects between TiKV and TiFlash for query execution, optimizing for cost and performance. This ensures efficient query processing, reducing computational costs.\\n- **Performance Metrics:** Case studies show significant improvements in query latency and throughput, with scenarios demonstrating up to a 41% reduction in latency and a 108% increase in QPS. This efficiency translates to lower operational costs.\\n\\n**MySQL RDS:**\\n- **Performance Schema for Analytics:** While MySQL provides tools for analyzing query performance, it lacks the integrated OLAP capabilities of TiDB, potentially leading to less efficient query processing for analytical workloads.\\n\\n### Scalability Benefits\\n\\n**TiDB Serverless HTAP:**\\n- **Independent Scaling:** TiDB supports independent scaling of computing and storage resources, allowing organizations to optimize resource utilization and scale according to their needs without incurring unnecessary costs.\\n- **Hybrid Workload Isolation:** The architecture allows for the isolation of OLTP and OLAP workloads, ensuring that analytical queries do not impact transactional performance, maintaining system stability and reducing the need for additional resources.\\n\\n**MySQL RDS:**\\n- **Scaling Limitations:** While MySQL RDS can scale, it may require more manual intervention and planning, especially when dealing with high transaction volumes and complex analytical queries.\\n\\n### Case Study Insights\\n\\nCase studies highlight that TiDB HTAP's integration of OLTP and OLAP within a single system provides significant cost savings by reducing the need for multiple systems and extensive DevOps resources. The architecture's ability to handle hybrid workloads and real-time processing makes it a versatile and cost-effective solution for businesses with massive data and high transaction volumes.\\n\\nIn conclusion, TiDB Serverless HTAP offers a more cost-effective and efficient solution compared to MySQL RDS, particularly for organizations looking to streamline their data processing and analysis capabilities. The integration of transactional and analytical processing, combined with automated scaling and optimized query execution, results in substantial cost savings and improved performance.\", 'reasoning': 'Okay, so I need to update the plan based on the suggestions provided. Let me see what the original plan was and what changes are needed.\\n\\nThe original plan had several steps to analyze TiDB\\'s HTAP architecture and compare it with MySQL RDS. It used vector_search, retrieve_knowledge_graph, and llm_generate tools to gather and synthesize information. Now, the suggestions mention adding steps to get quantitative data and case studies, modifying the final prompt to include specific metrics, and reviewing steps for redundancy.\\n\\nFirst, I should add new retrieval steps for cost performance metrics and case studies. That means I\\'ll include vector_search and retrieve_knowledge_graph for these topics. I\\'ll insert these after the existing retrieval steps but before the summaries.\\n\\nNext, I\\'ll modify the final llm_generate prompt to explicitly ask for a comparative discussion with specific metrics. I\\'ll make sure the prompt includes examples like reduced infrastructure overhead and scalability benefits.\\n\\nI also need to check if any steps are redundant. The current plan seems to have distinct steps, so maybe no changes are needed there. But I\\'ll make sure each new step contributes uniquely.\\n\\nNow, I\\'ll structure the updated plan. After the initial steps (0-8), I\\'ll add the new steps 9 and 10 for metrics and case studies, then steps 11 and 12 to summarize them. Finally, I\\'ll update the final step (13) with the new prompt.\\n\\nI have to ensure that all output variables are correctly referenced and that the final answer variable is \"final_answer\". Also, I\\'ll make sure the sequence numbers are correct and incrementing properly.\\n\\nLet me outline the steps:\\n\\n1. Keep steps 0-8 as they are.\\n2. Add step 9: vector_search for cost performance metrics.\\n3. Add step 10: retrieve_knowledge_graph for the same.\\n4. Add step 11: llm_generate to summarize metrics.\\n5. Add step 12: vector_search for case studies.\\n6. Add step 13: retrieve_knowledge_graph for case studies.\\n7. Add step 14: llm_generate to summarize case studies.\\n8. Update step 15: llm_generate with the new prompt.\\n\\nWait, but the original plan ends at step 9. So after adding the new steps, the final step becomes step 15. I need to adjust the sequence numbers accordingly.\\n\\nI think that\\'s the plan. Now, I\\'ll structure it into JSON, making sure each step is correctly formatted and the variables are properly assigned.', 'plan': [{'parameters': {'output_vars': ['tidb_htap_info'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'HTAP architecture of TiDB Serverless', 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 0, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['tidb_htap_kg'], 'tool_name': 'retrieve_knowledge_graph', 'tool_params': {'query': 'HTAP architecture of TiDB Serverless'}}, 'seq_no': 1, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['tidb_htap_summary'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': None, 'prompt': 'Summarize the HTAP architecture of TiDB Serverless based on the following information.

DM支持在线DDL工具如gh-ost和pt-osc，以避免迁移不必要的中间数据。然而，确保在使用这些工具时，DM的版本支持相应的功能。例如，在v2.0.5及之后的版本中，`online-ddl-scheme`已被弃用，需使用`online-ddl`配置项。更多信息请参考[TiDB Data Migration Support for Online DDL Tools](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/dm-online-ddl-tool-support)。\\n\\n2. **任务模式兼容性**：\\n   - 在使用`task-mode: all`时，如果上游数据库启用了GTID模式但没有数据，可能会导致任务无法启动。此问题在某些版本中已被修复，建议检查版本更新日志以获取更多信息。\\n\\n### 性能调优问题\\n\\n1. **Binlog事件过滤**：\\n   - DM提供了多种类型的过滤器，允许用户预定义事件类型、正则表达式和SQL表达式，以在数据迁移过程中过滤掉不必要的MySQL Binlog事件。这可以减少下游需要处理的Binlog事件数量，从而提高迁移效率。详细的配置指南可以参考[TiDB Data Migration Binlog Event Filter](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/dm-binlog-event-filter)。\\n\\n2. **表模式管理**：\\n   - 在增量复制过程中，DM需要维护内部表模式信息以生成SQL语句。用户可以使用`binlog-schema`命令来获取、修改或删除DM中维护的内部表模式，以解决因表模式不匹配导致的迁移中断问题。更多信息请参考[Manage Table Schemas of Tables to Be Migrated Using TiDB Data Migration](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/dm-manage-schema)。\\n\\n通过了解这些常见问题及其解决办法，用户可以更有效地配置和管理DM任务，确保数据迁移过程的顺利进行。如果需要获取最新的信息或确保所有命令、参数和配置示例是最新的，请参考提供的官方文档链接。', 'reasoning': '好的，我需要分析用户提供的计划，并根据建议进行更新。首先，我阅读了用户提供的详细计划，包括目标输入、当前计划、执行状态以及建议的改进。目标是生成一个关于TiDB数据迁移（DM）工具的关键点指南，包括安装、配置和使用细节。\\n\\n当前计划包括四个步骤：推理、检索知识图谱、向量搜索文档片段和生成指南。执行到第二步，检索知识图谱已经完成，接下来是向量搜索。\\n\\n用户提出的建议有三个主要点：\\n1. 在生成最终答案前增加验证步骤，确保所有信息是最新的。\\n2. 整合向量搜索结果，补充更多实际案例和特殊场景说明。\\n3. 在配置文件和任务创建部分增加常见问题及其解决办法的指引。\\n\\n接下来，我需要评估这些建议如何与当前执行结果和整体目标对齐。验证步骤可以确保信息的准确性和及时性，这对于提供可靠指南至关重要。整合向量搜索结果可以丰富内容，涵盖更多实际使用场景，使指南更全面。增加常见问题指引可以帮助用户解决实际问题，提升用户体验。\\n\\n然后，我需要确定哪些建议对实现目标贡献最大，并优先处理。验证步骤和整合向量搜索结果都是高优先级，因为它们直接影响内容的准确性和全面性。常见问题指引虽然重要，但可能在后续步骤中处理。\\n\\n接下来，我需要提出解决方案，修改现有步骤或添加新步骤。首先，在向量搜索后增加一个步骤，使用LLM生成工具对文档片段进行详细分析，提取关键点，如在线DDL配置、异常处理和binlog过滤。然后，在生成指南前增加验证步骤，交叉比对最新官方文档，确保所有信息正确。最后，在指南中加入常见问题部分，帮助用户解决兼容性和性能调优问题。\\n\\n在更新计划时，我需要确保变量引用正确，不重复已执行的步骤，并保持序列号连续。同时，遵循VM规范，确保指令类型和参数正确。\\n\\n最后，我需要评估更新后的计划是否满足用户需求，是否高效，是否处理了潜在问题。确保每个步骤都直接支持目标，并且计划结构清晰，易于执行。', 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': '为了解决关于TiDB DM工具的关键点，我们首先从知识图谱中获取结构化信息，然后通过向量搜索查找详细文档片段。接着，我们对文档片段进行详细分析，提取关键点和实际案例。然后，我们使用LLM生成工具将这些信息整合成一个全面的指南，并在生成前进行验证以确保信息的准确性。最后，我们加入常见问题及其解决方法，以提高指南的实用性。', 'dependency_analysis': '步骤1涉及获取结构化知识。步骤2涉及搜索详细文档。步骤3分析文档片段。步骤4验证信息。步骤5生成最终指南。步骤6加入常见问题。'}, 'seq_no': 0, 'type': 'reasoning'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['dm_knowledge'], 'tool_name': 'retrieve_knowledge_graph', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB Data Migration (DM) tool features and setup'}}, 'seq_no': 1, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['dm_documentation_snippets'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'How to set up and use TiDB Data Migration (DM) tool', 'top_k': 10}}, 'seq_no': 2, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['dm_document_analysis'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': '${dm_documentation_snippets}', 'prompt': '分析以下TiDB数据迁移工具的文档片段，提取关键点和实际使用案例，特别是在线DDL配置、异常处理和binlog事件过滤的详细说明。请以详细的中文文本形式返回。'}}, 'seq_no': 3, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['dm_validation'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': 'DM工具的知识：${dm_knowledge}\\n文档片段分析：${dm_document_analysis}', 'prompt': '请验证以上信息是否与最新的官方文档一致，确保所有命令、参数和配置示例都是最新和正确的。如果发现不一致，请指出并提供正确的信息。'}}, 'seq_no': 4, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['dm_guide'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': 'DM工具的知识：${dm_knowledge}\\n文档片段分析：${dm_document_analysis}\\n验证结果：${dm_validation}', 'prompt': '根据TiDB数据迁移工具的特性和设置，提供一个详细的指南，包括安装、配置和使用细节。特别注意在线DDL配置、异常处理和binlog事件过滤的详细说明。请确保文本使用中文。'}}, 'seq_no': 5, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['dm_common_issues'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': 'DM工具的知识：${dm_knowledge}\\n文档片段分析：${dm_document_analysis}\\n验证结果：${dm_validation}', 'prompt': '针对DM工具的配置文件和任务创建部分，列出常见问题及其解决办法，特别是版本兼容性和性能调优方面的挑战。请确保文本使用中文。'}}, 'seq_no': 6, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'final_answer': '${dm_guide}\\n\\n${dm_common_issues}'}, 'seq_no': 7, 'type': 'assign'}]}, {'commit_hash': '3ccafabe468b4f5cb23c5521f2ed7ea0', 'committed_at': '2025-02-23T15:16:37', 'description': 'Executed seq_no: 5, step: assign', 'seq_no': 5, 'commit_type': 'StepExecution', 'parent_hash': '0fb6f4d1f30c44b193aa6e034a0f9330', 'final_answer': '### TiDB 数据迁移（DM）工具使用指南\\n\\nTiDB 数据迁移（DM）是由 PingCAP 开发的一个综合工具，用于从 MySQL 兼容的数据库（如 MySQL、MariaDB 和 Amazon Aurora）迁移和复制数据到 TiDB。以下是关于如何安装、配置和使用 DM 的详细指南。\\n\\n#### 1. 安装步骤和要求\\n\\n**安装要求**：\\n- 操作系统：支持 Red Hat Enterprise Linux、CentOS、Oracle Enterprise Linux 和 Ubuntu。\\n- 架构：Intel x86-64。\\n\\n**安装步骤**：\\n1. **安装 TiUP**：TiUP 是 TiDB 的包管理工具，用于安装和管理 DM。\\n   ```shell\\n   curl --proto \\'=https\\' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://tiup-mirrors.pingcap.com/install.sh | sh\\n   tiup install dm dmctl\\n   ```\\n   参考链接：[TiDB Data Migration Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/dm-overview)\\n\\n#### 2. 配置参数和示例\\n\\n**数据源配置**：\\n- 创建数据源配置文件 `source-mysql-01.yaml`：\\n  ```yaml\\n  source-id: \"mysql-01\"\\n  from:\\n    host: \"127.0.0.1\"\\n    port: 3306\\n    user: \"root\"\\n    password: \"加密后的密码\"\\n  ```\\n- 使用 `tiup dmctl` 加载数据源：\\n  ```shell\\n  tiup dmctl --master-addr <master-addr> operate-source create ./source-mysql-01.yaml\\n  ```\\n  参考链接：[Create a Data Source for TiDB Data Migration](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/quick-start-create-source)\\n\\n#### 3. 使用场景和最佳实践\\n\\n- **全量和增量数据迁移**：支持从单个 MySQL 实例或多个分片实例迁移数据。\\n- **高可用性**：支持在不同节点上自由调度数据迁移任务，节点故障时任务不受影响。\\n- **在线 DDL 优化**：支持使用 gh-ost 和 pt-osc 工具进行在线模式变更，避免不必要的数据迁移。\\n\\n#### 4. 监控配置\\n\\n- **Prometheus 和 Grafana**：在使用 TiUP 部署 DM 时，可以选择部署 Prometheus 和 Grafana 以监控 DM 的运行状态。\\n- **日志目录**：\\n  -

**配置文件的正确性**：验证`topology.yaml`配置文件中的信息是否正确，特别是IP地址、端口和路径设置。\\n\\n### 4. 添加节点后的总结步骤\\n\\n- **重申前提条件**：确保所有前提条件都已满足，包括硬件和软件要求。\\n- **核对配置一致性**：在所有节点上核对配置文件的一致性，确保新节点的配置与现有节点一致。\\n\\n### 5. 备份建议\\n\\n- **配置备份**：在进行任何更改之前，备份现有的配置文件。\\n- **数据备份**：定期备份数据，以防止数据丢失。\\n\\n### 6. 新节点在集群中的角色和与现有节点的交互细节\\n\\n- **新节点的角色**：根据配置，新节点可以是DM-master或DM-worker。确保新节点的角色与集群的需求相匹配。\\n- **与现有节点的交互**：新节点应能够与现有节点正常通信，特别是在数据迁移任务中，DM-worker节点需要与DM-master节点保持良好的通信。\\n\\n通过以上步骤，您可以成功地将新节点添加到TiDB DM集群中。有关更多详细信息，请参考[TiDB

Let me go through this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I read the original plan. It has five steps: assigning comparison metrics, gathering info on TiDB\\'s vector search, gathering info on other solutions, comparing them, and generating the final report. The user\\'s suggestion says that the remaining steps could be improved for a more comprehensive analysis. They suggest adding a step to get benchmark data from independent sources for Elasticsearch, Pinecone, and FAISS. Also, they want the llm_generate step to include numerical comparisons and qualitative details, and a review step to ensure data consistency.\\n\\nSo, I need to incorporate these suggestions. Let me think about how to do that.\\n\\nThe current plan has five steps. The last executed step is step 1, which is the first calling instruction. So, I need to add new steps after step 2.\\n\\nFirst, after step 2, I should add a new step to retrieve benchmark data. This will involve using the vector_search tool again but with a specific query about benchmark data for the competitors. This data will provide numerical metrics like query latency and throughput, which are crucial for comparison.\\n\\nNext, I need to modify the llm_generate step. The original step uses the context from both TiDB and other solutions but doesn\\'t explicitly ask for numerical comparisons. I should update the prompt to emphasize including numerical data and qualitative aspects, ensuring that both TiDB\\'s status and competitors\\' readiness are covered.\\n\\nAfter that, adding a review step is important. This step will cross-verify the data to ensure consistency and balance. Using llm_generate again, the prompt should ask for validation of the data, checking for any discrepancies or areas needing clarification.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that the output variables are correctly named and that each step references the right variables. For example, the benchmark data should be stored in a new variable, and the review step should reference all relevant variables.\\n\\nNow, considering the structure, I\\'ll insert the new steps after step 2. So, the plan will have steps 0, 1, 2, then the new steps 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as the final answer.\\n\\nI should make sure that each new step is properly formatted, with the correct tool name, parameters, and output variables. Also, the final answer must be assigned to the variable \"final_answer\" in the last step.\\n\\nLet me outline the changes:\\n\\n1. After step 2, add a step to retrieve benchmark data for competitors using vector_search.\\n2. Modify the llm_generate step to include explicit numerical and qualitative comparisons.\\n3. Add a review step using llm_generate to validate the data consistency.\\n4. Ensure all output variables are correctly referenced in subsequent steps.\\n\\nI should also check that the sequence numbers are correct and that each step logically follows the previous one without redundancy.\\n\\nAnother thing to consider is whether the tools used can handle the new tasks. The vector_search tool should be able to retrieve benchmark data if such information exists in the documentation. The llm_generate tool can process the data and produce the required analysis.\\n\\nI think this approach will make the analysis more thorough and reliable, addressing the user\\'s concerns about the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the comparison.', 'plan_commit_hash': '191f91feba9a483a8b6fd424e8686254', 'answers': [{'commit_hash': 'c6418a71fb0240ecbe2e9cf8c0521557', 'committed_at': '2025-02-22T20:40:31', 'description': 'Executed seq_no: 4, step: assign', 'seq_no': 4, 'commit_type': 'StepExecution', 'parent_hash': '07d084a3319647e895636ca77e6cff1b', 'final_answer': \"When comparing TiDB Vector Search with other vector search solutions, several key metrics can be considered: query latency, throughput, scalability, and resource utilization. Here's a breakdown based on the available information:\\n\\n1. **Query Latency**: \\n   - TiDB Vector Search is designed to perform Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) queries efficiently. The use of vector search indexes, such as the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm, allows TiDB to complete vector search queries in milliseconds, which is crucial for applications requiring real-time responses. However, the feature is currently experimental and not recommended for production environments, which might affect its reliability in terms of consistent low latency [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/vector-search-improve-performance).\\n\\n2. **Throughput**: \\n   - The throughput of TiDB Vector Search can be significantly enhanced by using vector search indexes, which improve query performance by 10x or more. This improvement comes with a minor trade-off in recall rate, which is a common consideration in ANN-based solutions [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/vector-search-improve-performance).\\n\\n3. **Scalability**:\\n   - TiDB Vector Search supports storing vectors of up to 16,383 dimensions, accommodating most embedding models. This capability, combined with TiDB's distributed architecture, allows it to scale with increasing data sizes and query volumes. However, the feature's experimental status suggests that scalability might still be under evaluation for very large-scale deployments [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/vector-search-integration-overview).\\n\\n4. **Resource Utilization**:\\n   - TiDB Vector Search can optimize resource utilization by excluding vector columns from query results, reducing data transfer between the server and client. Additionally, warming up indexes can prevent cold access latency, which is beneficial for maintaining efficient resource use during query execution [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/vector-search-improve-performance).\\n\\nOverall, TiDB Vector Search offers promising features for vector search tasks, particularly in terms of query latency and throughput. However, its experimental nature means that users should carefully consider its current limitations and suitability for production environments.

Here\\'s a detailed comparison based on these metrics:\\n\\n### Query Latency\\n- **TiDB Vector Search**: TiDB\\'s vector search is designed to perform Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) queries efficiently. The use of vector search indexes can improve query performance by 10x or more, although this comes with a slight decrease in recall rate. The latency can be affected by whether the index is \"warm\" or \"cold,\" with cold accesses requiring more time due to loading from storage [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/vector-search-improve-performance).\\n- **Elasticsearch**: Elasticsearch is known for its robust search capabilities, including vector search. However, its performance can vary significantly based on the configuration and the size of the dataset. Elasticsearch generally offers good latency for smaller datasets but may require optimization for larger ones.\\n- **Pinecone**: Pinecone is a managed vector database service optimized for low-latency vector search. It typically offers very low query latency due to its specialized infrastructure and optimizations for vector operations.\\n- **FAISS**: FAISS, developed by Facebook AI, is optimized for high-speed nearest neighbor search in large datasets. It is known for its low latency, especially when using GPU acceleration, making it suitable for applications requiring real-time search.\\n\\n### Throughput\\n- **TiDB Vector Search**: The throughput of TiDB\\'s vector search can be enhanced by using vector indexes, which allow for parallel processing of queries. However, the throughput is also dependent on the underlying hardware and the configuration of the TiDB cluster [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/vector-search-index).\\n- **Elasticsearch**: Elasticsearch can handle high throughput, especially when deployed in a distributed setup. Its performance scales with the number of nodes in the cluster, allowing for high query throughput.\\n- **Pinecone**: Pinecone is designed to handle high throughput with its distributed architecture, making it suitable for applications with high query volumes.\\n- **FAISS**: FAISS can achieve high throughput, particularly when using approximate search methods and GPU acceleration. It is well-suited for batch processing of queries.\\n\\n### Scalability\\n- **TiDB Vector Search**: TiDB is a distributed SQL database that can scale horizontally. It supports large datasets and can handle a significant number of queries, although the performance will depend on the cluster configuration and the use of TiFlash nodes for vector indexing [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/vector-search-index).\\n- **Elasticsearch**: Elasticsearch is highly scalable and can handle large datasets by distributing data across multiple nodes. It supports sharding and replication, which helps in scaling both data size and query load.\\n- **Pinecone**: Pinecone is built to scale seamlessly with data size and query load. It abstracts the complexity of scaling from the user, providing a managed service that automatically adjusts resources as needed.\\n- **FAISS**: FAISS is designed for scalability in terms of data size, particularly with its support for large-scale datasets. However, it requires careful management of resources and may need additional infrastructure for very large deployments.\\n\\n### Resource Utilization\\n- **TiDB Vector Search**: Resource utilization in TiDB can be optimized by using vector indexes and ensuring that indexes are fully built and warmed up. The use of TiFlash nodes can also help in offloading vector processing tasks [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/vector-search-improve-performance).\\n- **Elasticsearch**: Elasticsearch can be resource-intensive, especially for large-scale deployments. It requires careful tuning of memory and CPU resources to maintain optimal performance.\\n- **Pinecone**: As a managed service, Pinecone optimizes resource utilization automatically, providing efficient use of resources without requiring user intervention.\\n- **FAISS**: FAISS is efficient in terms of resource utilization, especially when using approximate search methods. It can leverage GPU resources effectively to enhance performance.\\n\\nIn summary, each of these solutions has its strengths and is suited to different use cases. TiDB Vector Search offers strong integration with SQL databases and is suitable for applications that require both relational and vector search capabilities.

The use of vector search indexes can improve query performance by 10x or more, although it is still in an experimental phase and not recommended for production environments ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/vector-search-improve-performance)).\\n- **Elasticsearch**: Known for its robust search capabilities, Elasticsearch can handle vector searches with relatively low latency, especially when optimized with appropriate indexing and caching strategies.\\n- **Pinecone**: Pinecone is optimized for vector search and typically offers very low latency due to its specialized infrastructure designed for high-speed vector operations.\\n- **FAISS**: Developed by Facebook, FAISS is highly optimized for fast vector similarity search, often achieving very low latency due to its efficient use of hardware acceleration and optimized algorithms.\\n\\n### Throughput\\n- **TiDB Vector Search**: While specific throughput numbers are not provided, TiDB's vector search is expected to handle a moderate number of queries efficiently, especially when vector indexes are fully built and optimized ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/vector-search-index)).\\n- **Elasticsearch**: Offers high throughput capabilities, especially when deployed in a distributed setup, allowing it to handle large volumes of queries simultaneously.\\n- **Pinecone**: Designed for high throughput, Pinecone can manage a large number of concurrent queries due to its cloud-native architecture.\\n- **FAISS**: FAISS can achieve high throughput, particularly when deployed on GPU-enabled hardware, making it suitable for large-scale vector search tasks.\\n\\n### Scalability\\n- **TiDB Vector Search**: TiDB is scalable in terms of data size and can handle large datasets, but the vector search feature is still experimental and may have limitations in scaling the number of queries ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/vector-search-overview)).\\n- **Elasticsearch**: Highly scalable, Elasticsearch can manage large datasets and a high number of queries by distributing the load across multiple nodes.\\n- **Pinecone**: Offers excellent scalability, both in terms of data size and query volume, due to its cloud-based infrastructure that can dynamically scale resources.\\n- **FAISS**: While FAISS itself is not a distributed system, it can be integrated into larger systems to handle scalability by distributing the workload across multiple instances.\\n\\n### Resource Utilization\\n- **TiDB Vector Search**: Resource utilization can be optimized by reducing vector dimensions and excluding vector columns from query results to minimize data transfer ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/vector-search-improve-performance)).\\n- **Elasticsearch**: Resource utilization is generally high, especially in terms of memory and CPU, due to its need to maintain indices and handle complex queries.\\n- **Pinecone**: Efficient in resource utilization, Pinecone's managed service abstracts much of the complexity, allowing for optimized use of resources.\\n- **FAISS**: FAISS is highly efficient in resource utilization, particularly when leveraging GPU acceleration, which can significantly reduce the computational load on CPUs.\\n\\nIn summary, each of these vector search solutions has its strengths and is suited to different use cases. TiDB Vector Search is promising but still experimental, while Elasticsearch offers robust search capabilities with high scalability. Pinecone excels in low latency and high throughput, and FAISS is ideal for environments where hardware acceleration can be leveraged for fast vector searches.

Let me start by understanding what the user wants. They provided a plan that compares TiDB Vector Search with other solutions, focusing on performance and scalability. The suggestions mention adding a step to gather benchmark data and modifying the llm_generate steps to include numerical comparisons and a review step for consistency.\\n\\nFirst, I'll look at the current plan. It has steps to assign comparison metrics, gather TiDB info, gather other solutions' info, generate a comparison, and then review. The user wants to add a step after step 2 to get benchmark data using a tool like retrieve_knowledge_graph. That makes sense because it will provide more detailed metrics from academic or industry sources.\\n\\nNext, I need to adjust the llm_generate step. The existing prompt doesn't explicitly ask for numerical comparisons, so I'll modify it to include both numerical data and qualitative insights. This will make the analysis more thorough.\\n\\nThen, adding a review step using llm_generate will help cross-verify the data for consistency. This ensures that the comparison analysis is accurate and reliable.\\n\\nI also need to make sure that the output variables are correctly referenced in each step. The new benchmark data will be stored in a variable, which will be used in the comparison analysis and review steps.\\n\\nI'll structure the updated plan by inserting the new steps after step 2, ensuring that the sequence numbers are correct and that each step logically follows the previous one without redundancy.\\n\\nFinally, I'll ensure that the plan complies with the VM specification, avoiding any redundant steps and ensuring all variables are properly referenced.

TiDB使用两阶段提交来确保分布式事务的一致性。2PC包括准备阶段和提交阶段。在准备阶段，TiDB将所有变更发送到相关的TiKV节点，并等待确认。在提交阶段，所有节点确认准备就绪后，TiDB正式提交事务。\\n   - 事务在2PC提交阶段完成后，TiDB会向客户端返回写成功的确认。这意味着在网络分区或节点故障的情况下，数据的一致性仍然能够得到保证。\\n\\n5. **异步的应用阶段**：\\n

写入阶段**：这个阶段的主要任务是将事务的变更记录到日志中，并确保这些日志被持久化。WAL 的写入是一个顺序的过程，确保在数据写入到主存储之前，所有变更都被记录下来。这个阶段的完成标志着数据的持久化已经得到保证，因此可以向客户端返回写成功确认。\\n\\n2.

写入可以更快地完成，从而加快事务提交的速度。由于应用阶段的操作可以与 WAL 写入并行进行，因此整体的事务提交延迟可以显著减少。\\n\\n在这种模式下，虽然 WAL 写入和应用是并行进行的，但向客户端返回写成功确认的时机仍然是在 WAL 写入完成之后。这是因为 WAL 的持久化是确保数据安全的关键步骤。\\n\\n有关更多技术细节和配置建议，可以参考 [TiDB

This ensures that even in the event of a system failure, the data can be recovered. In TiKV, which is the storage engine for TiDB, all data writes are initially directed to the WAL. This step is crucial for maintaining atomicity and durability, two of the ACID properties.\\n   - **Timing**: The time taken to write to the WAL is typically less than 1 second (P99), ensuring that the logging process does not become a bottleneck.\\n\\n2. **Application Stage**:\\n   - **Purpose**: After the WAL has been written, the changes are applied to the in-memory structures like MemTables. Once the MemTable reaches its size limit, its contents are flushed to SST files on disk. This stage ensures that the data is not only logged but also committed to the database.\\n   - **Process**: The application of logs involves writing the committed proposals to the KV database. This is handled by the Apply thread in TiKV, which notifies the system once the write request is completed.\\n\\nThe confirmation of a successful write is returned after the WAL write stage, as this ensures that the data is safely logged and can be recovered if necessary. The application stage, while important for committing data to the database, does not delay the confirmation of a successful write.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on TiDB's architecture and transaction processing, you can refer to the following sources:\\n- [TiDB Architecture](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-architecture)\\n- [Performance Analysis and Tuning](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/performance-tuning-methods)\", 'reasoning': '好，我现在需要帮助用户更新他们的虚拟机执行计划。用户的目标是分析TiDB在提交事务时，是在WAL写入成功后立即返回成功确认，还是在应用阶段完成后才返回确认。当前计划已经执行了第一步，现在需要根据建议进行优化。\\n\\n首先，我需要理解用户提供的计划和执行情况。当前计划分为四个步骤：初始推理，检索知识图谱，向量搜索，最后生成回答。用户已经执行到第一步，现在需要处理剩下的步骤。根据用户的建议，剩余的步骤需要改进以生成更全面的回答。\\n\\n用户建议的改进包括：\\n1. 增加一个综合步骤，将知识图谱和向量搜索的结果进行交叉验证，提取关键信息。\\n2. 修改llm_generate的使用，将获取的文档和知识图谱数据显式地加入prompt中，确保模型明确验证WAL写入后的即时确认这一点。\\n3. 增加对TiDB官方文档的引用，提升回答的权威性和准确性。\\n\\n接下来，我需要分析如何将这些建议融入到当前的计划中。首先，增加一个综合步骤，这可能涉及到使用assign指令来合并和处理数据。其次，调整llm_generate的参数，确保上下文包含所有必要的信息。最后，考虑在回答中加入官方文档的引用，这可能需要在生成回答时明确提示模型。\\n\\n在处理过程中，我需要确保变量的正确引用，避免使用已经被垃圾回收的变量。同时，保持计划的结构符合VM的规范，确保每个步骤都有正确的seq_no和类型。\\n\\n具体来说，我可能会在步骤2和3之间插入一个新的步骤，用于综合知识图谱和向量搜索的结果。然后，在最后的llm_generate步骤中，将这些综合后的信息作为上下文提供给模型，确保生成的回答准确且全面。\\n\\n最后，我需要验证计划的每一步是否都符合VM的规范，确保没有遗漏任何必要的参数，并且变量引用正确。同时，确保最终的答案变量名为\"final_answer\"，符合VM的要求。', 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': '为了确定TiDB在提交事务时是在WAL写入成功后立即返回成功确认，还是在应用阶段完成后才返回确认，我们需要综合分析TiDB的事务提交流程。首先，通过知识图谱检索获取TiDB事务提交的基本结构和关键阶段，然后通过向量搜索获取详细的文档片段。接下来，对这些信息进行交叉验证，提取关键点，最后生成准确的回答。', 'dependency_analysis': '步骤1和步骤2是独立的，步骤3依赖于步骤1和步骤2的结果。步骤4需要步骤3的输出作为输入。'}, 'seq_no': 0, 'type': 'reasoning'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['transaction_commit_graph'], 'tool_name': 'retrieve_knowledge_graph', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB事务提交流程，WAL和应用阶段的作用'}}, 'seq_no': 1, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['transaction_commit_docs'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB事务提交流程，WAL和应用阶段的作用', 'top_k': 3}}, 'seq_no': 2, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['synthesized_info'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': '知识图谱数据: ${transaction_commit_graph}\\n文档: ${transaction_commit_docs}', 'prompt': '根据提供的知识图谱和文档片段，提取TiDB事务提交流程中WAL写入和应用阶段的关键信息，确保每个阶段的作用和时序准确无误。'}}, 'seq_no': 3, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['final_answer'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': '知识图谱数据: ${transaction_commit_graph}\\n文档: ${transaction_commit_docs}\\n组合书本: ${synthesized_info}', 'prompt': '在TiDB中，事务提交时，系统是在WAL成功写入后立即返回写成功确认，还是在应用阶段完成后才返回确认？请详细解释事务提交的各个阶段，并引用来源支持你的结论。'}}, 'seq_no': 4, 'type': 'calling'}]}, {'commit_hash': '50e8c64855ee4e77a0058e85c3b5b1f6', 'committed_at': '2025-02-23T13:33:45', 'description': \"Executed seq_no: 4, step: 'calling', tool: llm_generate\", 'seq_no': 4, 'commit_type': 'StepExecution', 'parent_hash': '5f4b18635b90451eb618009ae72354fe', 'final_answer': \"In TiDB, the transaction commit process involves several key stages to ensure data durability and consistency.

Let me first understand the problem and the current plan.\\n\\nThe goal is to determine if TiDB Vector Search is open-source and can be self-hosted. The current plan uses vector_search to get info on whether it\\'s open-source and if it can be self-hosted, then uses llm_generate to synthesize the answer.\\n\\nThe user suggested adding an extra step to specifically target self-hosting documentation, like checking TiDB Self-Managed clusters, and modifying the final prompt to include more details. They also want the final answer to contrast deployment modes, mention experimental status, and reference GitHub issues.\\n\\nSo, I need to modify the plan to include these changes. Let me think about how to do that.\\n\\nFirst, the current plan has three steps. The first two are vector_search calls, and the third is llm_generate. The suggestion is to add another vector_search step for self-hosting, so I\\'ll insert that after the first two steps.\\n\\nWait, no, the current plan has two vector_search steps: one for open-source and one for self-hosting. The user wants to add another retrieval step specifically for self-hosting documentation, maybe querying the GitHub repository or specific documentation pages. So perhaps I should add a third vector_search call targeting TiDB Self-Managed clusters.\\n\\nBut looking at the current plan, the second step is already querying about self-hosting. Maybe the user wants a more detailed search, like looking into the GitHub repo or specific documentation pages. So perhaps I should adjust the second vector_search to include more specific queries, or add another step after the second one to get more detailed info.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to split the self-hosting into two parts: one general and one specific to TiDB Self-Managed clusters. So I\\'ll add a third vector_search step after the second one, with a query like \"TiDB Self-Managed clusters and Vector Search\".\\n\\nThen, in the llm_generate step, I need to include all three information sources. So the prompt should reference open_source_info, self_hosting_info, and self_managed_info.\\n\\nAlso, the prompt needs to explicitly contrast TiDB Cloud Serverless and TiDB Self-Managed, mention the experimental status if any, and reference GitHub issues as evidence of open-source nature.\\n\\nSo, I\\'ll adjust the llm_generate step to include these points in the prompt.\\n\\nLet me outline the steps:\\n\\n1. Keep the first two vector_search steps as they are.\\n2. Add a third vector_search step targeting TiDB Self-Managed clusters.\\n3. Modify the llm_generate step to include all three info variables and adjust the prompt accordingly.\\n\\nWait, but the current plan has seq_no 0 and 1 as vector_search, then seq_no 2 as llm_generate. So to add another vector_search, I need to insert it after step 1, making it step 2, and shift the llm_generate to step 3.\\n\\nWait, no. The current program counter is at 1, meaning step 1 has been executed. So the plan so far has executed step 0 (open_source_info) and step 1 (self_hosting_info). The next step is step 2, which is llm_generate.\\n\\nBut the user\\'s suggestion is to add another step before llm_generate to get more self-hosting info. So I need to insert a new step after step 1, making it step 2, and then adjust the llm_generate to step 3.\\n\\nSo the updated plan would have:\\n\\n- Step 0: vector_search for open_source_info\\n- Step 1: vector_search for self_hosting_info\\n- Step 2: vector_search for self_managed_info\\n- Step 3: llm_generate using all three info variables\\n\\nBut in the current plan, step 2 is llm_generate. So I need to modify the plan to add step 2 as the new vector_search and step 3 as llm_generate.\\n\\nWait, but the user\\'s instruction says to keep all steps up to and including step 0 unchanged. So step 0 remains as is. Then, the next steps after step 0 can be modified.\\n\\nWait, the current program counter is 1, meaning step 0 has been executed, and step 1 is next. The user\\'s instruction says to keep all steps up to and including step 0 unchanged. So step 0 remains, and steps 1 onwards can be modified.\\n\\nSo the current plan after step 0 is:\\n\\nStep 1: vector_search for self_hosting_info\\nStep 2: llm_generate\\n\\nThe user wants to add another vector_search step after step 1, so step 2 would be the new vector_search, and step 3 would be llm_generate.\\n\\nSo the updated plan would be:\\n\\n- Step 0: vector_search for open_source_info\\n- Step 1: vector_search for self_hosting_info\\n- Step 2: vector_search for self_managed_info\\n- Step 3: llm_generate using all three info variables\\n\\nBut in the original plan, step 1 is vector_search for self_hosting, and step 2 is llm_generate. So I need to insert a new step 2, making the llm_generate step 3.\\n\\nSo the new plan will have four steps, with step 3 being the llm_generate.\\n\\nIn the llm_generate step, the prompt needs to include all three info variables and address the additional points mentioned.\\n\\nSo, I\\'ll structure the plan accordingly, ensuring that each step is correctly numbered and that the output variables are properly referenced.\\n\\nI also need to make sure that the final answer variable is \"final_answer\" as per the specifications.\\n\\nLet me draft the updated plan:\\n\\n1.

This operation involves redistributing the leaders and peers of regions across different TiKV nodes to ensure even data distribution and reduce the load on the Placement Driver (PD).\\n\\n### Role in Region Management\\n\\nWhen a new table is created in TiDB, it initially starts with a single region. As data is inserted and the region size exceeds a predefined limit, the region splits into smaller regions. However, if all write operations target the same initial region, it can lead to a hotspot, where one node becomes overloaded with requests. To mitigate this, TiDB can pre-split regions and scatter them across different nodes. This pre-splitting and scattering help distribute the load more evenly from the start, preventing hotspots and improving write performance.\\n\\n### Load Balancing\\n\\nThe scatter region operation is particularly useful in scenarios with high write concurrency. By distributing regions across multiple nodes, TiDB ensures that no single node becomes a bottleneck, thus maintaining high availability and performance. This operation is often used in conjunction with the `SPLIT TABLE` SQL statement, which allows users to define how regions should be split and scattered based on specific table or index ranges.\\n\\nFor example, using the `SPLIT TABLE` statement, you can pre-split a table into a specified number of regions and scatter them to different nodes. This is especially beneficial when you anticipate a high volume of writes immediately after table creation. The `SHOW TABLE REGIONS` statement can then be used to verify the distribution of regions and ensure that the scattering has been successful.\\n\\n### Practical Usage\\n\\nIn practice, the scatter region operation is controlled by the `tidb_scatter_region` system variable, which determines whether TiDB should wait for regions to be pre-split and scattered before returning results after table creation. This is crucial for scenarios where intensive writes are expected, as it ensures that the data is evenly distributed across the cluster, thereby enhancing performance.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on how to use the scatter region operation and related SQL statements, you can refer to the following sources:\\n- [Split Region Documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sql-statement-split-region)\\n- [Highly Concurrent Write Best Practices](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/high-concurrency-best-practices)\\n- [SHOW TABLE REGIONS Documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sql-statement-show-table-regions)', 'reasoning': 'To address the goal of understanding the \"scatter region\" operation in TiDB, we need to break down the task into smaller, manageable steps.

It is designed to distribute data evenly across the TiKV nodes, thereby reducing the load on any single node and improving overall system performance.\\n\\n### Role in Region Management and Load Balancing\\n\\n1. **Region Management**: TiDB divides data into regions, which are the basic units of data distribution and replication. Each region is stored on multiple TiKV nodes for fault tolerance. The scatter region operation helps in distributing these regions across different nodes to prevent hotspots, which occur when too many requests are directed to a single node.\\n\\n2. **Load Balancing**: By scattering regions, TiDB ensures that the load is balanced across the cluster.

This pre-splitting is controlled by the `tidb_scatter_region` variable, which determines whether to wait for regions to be scattered before returning the result of the table creation. This is useful for handling intensive write operations right after table creation.\\n\\n- **SPLIT TABLE**: The `SPLIT TABLE` statement allows you to manually split a table into regions based on specified key ranges. After splitting, the scatter region operation can be used to distribute these newly created regions across the cluster.\\n\\n### Impact on Table Creation Latency\\n\\nEnabling the scatter region operation can increase the latency of table creation. This is because the system waits for the regions to be split and scattered before completing the table creation process. While this increases the initial setup time, it ensures that the table is optimally distributed across the cluster, which can significantly improve performance for subsequent operations.\\n\\n### Verifying Scattering with SHOW TABLE REGIONS\\n\\nTo verify that regions have been successfully scattered, you can use the `SHOW TABLE REGIONS` statement. This command provides details about the regions associated with a table, including their start and end keys, leader distribution, and whether they are currently being scattered.

Additionally, the impact on table creation latency and verification methods like SHOW TABLE REGIONS should be included.\\n\\nSo, the main goal is to enhance the final answer by adding these details. To do this, I need to modify the existing plan to incorporate these additional pieces of information.\\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll look at the current plan. The first two steps retrieve information using the knowledge graph and vector search. The third step uses an LLM to generate the final answer. To include the new details, I can enhance the prompt in the LLM generation step to explicitly request these aspects. However, to ensure thoroughness, it might be better to add another vector search step focused on these specific aspects before generating the final answer.\\n\\nWait, but the user\\'s suggestion says to keep all steps up to and including step 1 unchanged. So I can\\'t add another vector search step before step 2.

I can enhance the prompt in step 2 to include the additional details. Alternatively, I could assign the output of step 1 to a variable and then use that in the prompt, but perhaps a better approach is to include these details in the prompt.\\n\\nWait, the current plan\\'s step 2 uses both the knowledge graph and vector search outputs.

For example, I can ask the LLM to explain how scatter_region works with PRE_SPLIT_REGIONS and SPLIT TABLE, mention the impact on latency, and include verification methods.\\n\\nBut how can I ensure that the LLM includes all these points? I can structure the prompt to explicitly request each of these details. Alternatively, I could add another vector search step to gather more specific information, but since the user wants to keep steps up to step 1 unchanged, I should find a way within the existing structure.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I can modify the vector search query in step 1 to include these specific terms, but that might not be necessary.

Let me start by understanding the current plan and the suggestions provided.\\n\\nThe current plan has three steps: retrieve knowledge from the knowledge graph, perform a vector search, and then generate the final answer using an LLM. The suggestions mention that while the current steps are detailed, they could be improved by including more specific usage examples, trade-offs, and related concepts like PRE_SPLIT_REGIONS and SPLIT TABLE. Additionally, the impact on table creation latency and verification methods like SHOW TABLE REGIONS should be included.\\n\\nSo, the main goal is to enhance the final answer by adding these details. To do this, I need to modify the existing plan to incorporate these additional pieces of information.\\n\\nFirst, I\\'ll look at the current plan. The first two steps retrieve information using the knowledge graph and vector search. The third step uses an LLM to generate the final answer. To include the new details, I can enhance the prompt in the LLM generation step to explicitly request these aspects. However, to ensure thoroughness, it might be better to add another vector search step focused on these specific aspects before generating the final answer.\\n\\nWait, but the user\\'s suggestion says to keep all steps up to and including step 1 unchanged. So I can\\'t add another vector search step before step 2. Instead, I should modify the existing steps to include these details.\\n\\nLooking at the current plan, after step 1, which retrieves documents, step 2 uses the LLM to generate the answer. I can enhance the prompt in step 2 to include the specific aspects mentioned in the suggestions. For example, I can ask the LLM to explain how scatter_region works with PRE_SPLIT_REGIONS and SPLIT TABLE, mention the impact on latency, and include verification methods.\\n\\nBut how can I ensure that the LLM includes all these points? I can structure the prompt to explicitly request each of these details. Alternatively, I could add another vector search step to gather more specific information, but since the user wants to keep steps up to step 1 unchanged, I should find a way within the existing structure.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I can modify the vector search query in step 1 to include these specific terms, but that might not be necessary. Instead, enhancing the LLM prompt to include these points would suffice.\\n\\nSo, in step 2, the prompt can be updated to include questions about how scatter_region interacts with other TiDB features, the impact on performance, and how to verify the scattering. This way, the LLM will generate a more comprehensive answer.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that the final answer variable is correctly assigned and that the plan remains efficient. Since the user wants to keep steps up to step 1 unchanged, I can only modify step 2 and beyond. Therefore, I\\'ll adjust the prompt in step 2 to include the additional details.\\n\\nAnother consideration is whether the current output variables are sufficient. The current step 2 outputs \"final_answer\". Since we\\'re modifying the prompt, the output remains the same, so no change is needed there.\\n\\nI should also ensure that the prompt is in English and that the response aligns with the goal. By explicitly asking for these details, the answer will be more informative and meet the user\\'s expectations.\\n\\nSo, to summarize, the plan will be updated by modifying the prompt in the LLM generation step to include the specific aspects mentioned in the suggestions. This way, the final answer will be more comprehensive without adding new steps, thus keeping the plan efficient and aligned with the user\\'s instructions.\\n\\nNow, I\\'ll proceed to update the plan accordingly.', 'plan': [{'parameters': {'output_vars': ['scatter_region_knowledge'], 'tool_name': 'retrieve_knowledge_graph', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB scatter region operation'}}, 'seq_no': 0, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['scatter_region_docs'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'scatter region operation in TiDB', 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 1, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['final_answer'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': 'Knowledge graph data: ${scatter_region_knowledge}\\nDocuments: ${scatter_region_docs}', 'prompt': \"Explain what the 'scatter region' operation does in TiDB and how it is used.

This operation involves redistributing the leaders and peers of Regions across different TiKV nodes to ensure even data distribution and reduce the load on the Placement Driver (PD).\\n\\n### Role in Region Management and Load Balancing\\n\\n1. **Region Distribution**: When a new table is created in TiDB, it initially starts with a single Region. As data is inserted and the Region size exceeds a certain threshold, it splits into multiple Regions. The scatter region operation helps distribute these Regions across different nodes, preventing hotspots where too many write operations target a single node.\\n\\n2. **Load Balancing**: By scattering Regions, TiDB ensures that the workload is evenly distributed across the cluster. This is particularly important in scenarios with high write concurrency, as it helps avoid performance bottlenecks and ensures efficient resource utilization.\\n\\n### Interaction with Table Splitting\\n\\n- **SPLIT TABLE Statement**: TiDB provides the `SPLIT TABLE` SQL statement to manually pre-split a table into multiple Regions. This is useful for avoiding hotspots by distributing the data across multiple Regions from the start. For example, you can use the following command to split a table into 128 Regions:\\n  ```sql\\n  SPLIT TABLE test_hotspot BETWEEN (0) AND (9223372036854775807) REGIONS 128;\\n  ```\\n  After splitting, the scatter region operation can be used to distribute these Regions across the cluster. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sql-statement-split-region)\\n\\n### Performance Implications\\n\\n- **Improved Write Performance**: By scattering Regions, TiDB can handle high write loads more efficiently, as the load is balanced across multiple nodes. This reduces the likelihood of any single node becoming a bottleneck.\\n\\n- **Reduced Hotspots**: The scatter region operation helps mitigate hotspots, which occur when too many operations target a single Region or node. This is especially beneficial in scenarios with auto-increment primary keys or other sequential data patterns.\\n\\n### Troubleshooting Tips and Version Nuances\\n\\n- **Configuration**: The `tidb_scatter_region` system variable controls whether newly split Regions are scattered immediately. Enabling this can be beneficial for scenarios with intensive writes following table creation. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sql-statement-split-region)\\n\\n- **Version-Specific Features**: In TiDB v8.4.0, improvements were made to the Region merge process, which can affect how Regions are managed post-split. It\\'s important to be aware of these changes when upgrading or configuring your cluster. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/release-8.4.0)\\n\\n- **Monitoring and Verification**: After performing a scatter region operation, you can verify the distribution of Regions using the `SHOW TABLE REGIONS` statement. This helps ensure that the Regions are evenly distributed and that the scatter operation was successful. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sql-statement-show-table-regions)\\n\\nIn summary, the scatter region operation in TiDB is a vital tool for optimizing data distribution and load balancing, particularly in high-concurrency environments. By effectively managing Regions, TiDB can maintain performance and prevent hotspots, ensuring a smooth and efficient operation of the database cluster.', 'reasoning': 'Okay, so I\\'m trying to figure out how to update the plan based on the user\\'s suggestions and the current execution results. Let me start by understanding what\\'s been done so far and what needs to be changed.\\n\\nThe original goal is to explain the \"scatter region\" operation in TiDB, including its purpose and usage. The current plan involves three steps: retrieving knowledge from the knowledge graph, performing a vector search, and then using an LLM to generate the final answer. The program counter is at step 1, meaning the first step has been executed, and we\\'re about to proceed to the next steps.\\n\\nThe user provided some suggestions to improve the plan. They mentioned adding a separate retrieval step for version-specific documentation and release notes, enhancing the LLM prompt to include more details about interactions with other features and performance implications, and considering troubleshooting tips or version nuances.\\n\\nFirst, I need to assess these suggestions. Adding a step to gather version-specific information makes sense because it can provide more comprehensive and up-to-date details. This will ensure that the explanation isn\\'t just general but also covers any changes or best practices across different TiDB versions.\\n\\nNext, modifying the LLM prompt to include discussions about table splitting and performance implications will make the answer more thorough. It\\'s important to explain how \"scatter region\" interacts with other operations and how it affects system performance, as this gives a clearer picture of its role in TiDB.\\n\\nIncluding troubleshooting tips or version nuances is also beneficial. Users might encounter issues depending on their TiDB version, so having that information can help them apply the knowledge correctly.\\n\\nNow, looking at the current plan, after the initial knowledge graph retrieval, the next step is vector search. I\\'ll need to insert a new step after vector search to retrieve version-specific documentation. This will involve another vector search with a query focused on version notes and best practices. \\n\\nThen, the LLM generation step should be updated to include the new information from this additional search. The prompt should be expanded to cover the new topics like table splitting, performance, and version differences.\\n\\nI should also ensure that the output variables are correctly handled. Each new step will add variables that the LLM can use in its generation. The final answer should integrate all these aspects cohesively.\\n\\nI need to make sure that the sequence numbers are correct and that each step logically follows the previous one without redundancy. Also, I must avoid referencing variables that haven\\'t been created yet, as that could cause errors.\\n\\nIn summary, the plan needs to be updated by adding a step to retrieve version-specific information and modifying the LLM prompt to include more detailed aspects.

This is useful for avoiding hotspots by distributing the data across the cluster before significant data insertion begins. For example, you can use the following command to split a table into 128 Regions:\\n  ```sql\\n  SPLIT TABLE test_hotspot BETWEEN (0) AND (9223372036854775807) REGIONS 128;\\n  ```\\n  After splitting, the scatter region operation can be used to distribute these Regions across different nodes [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/high-concurrency-best-practices).\\n\\n### Performance Implications\\n\\n- **Pre-splitting and Scattering**: Pre-splitting tables and scattering Regions can significantly improve performance in write-heavy scenarios by preventing hotspots. However, it may increase the time taken for table creation, as the system waits for Regions to be split and scattered before returning control to the user [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sql-statement-split-region).\\n\\n- **Configuration**: The `tidb_scatter_region` global variable controls whether to wait for Regions to be pre-split and scattered before returning results after table creation. Setting this variable appropriately can help manage the trade-off between immediate availability and optimal performance [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sql-statement-split-region).\\n\\n### Troubleshooting Tips\\n\\n- **Monitoring Region Distribution**: You can use the `SHOW TABLE REGIONS` statement to monitor the distribution of Regions and ensure that they are evenly scattered. This can help identify and resolve any imbalances in Region distribution [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sql-statement-show-table-regions).\\n\\n- **Handling Hotspots**: If you encounter performance issues due to hotspots, consider using attributes like `SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS` or `AUTO_RANDOM` to distribute row IDs across multiple Regions. This can alleviate write hotspots by ensuring that data is not concentrated in a single Region [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sql-faq).\\n\\n### Version Nuances\\n\\n- **Version-Specific Features**: The behavior and configuration options related to region scattering may vary across different TiDB versions. For instance, improvements in region merge processes and configuration options for region management have been introduced in various releases, such as TiDB 8.4.0 [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/release-8.4.0).\\n\\nBy understanding and utilizing the scatter region operation effectively, you can optimize TiDB\\'s performance and ensure efficient data distribution across your cluster.', 'reasoning': 'Okay, I need to figure out how to update the existing plan based on the user\\'s suggestions.

Enhance the llm_generate step to ensure it covers all aspects, including version differences, edge cases, and best practices.\\n\\nI\\'ll go through each suggestion.\\n\\nFirst, adding a version check. This makes sense because the \"hint\" feature might behave differently across TiDB versions. I\\'ll insert a new step after the initial vector_search to call `vector_search` again with a query about version-specific behaviors. This will help gather any relevant information that might affect the explanation.\\n\\nNext, modifying the vector_search query. The current query is \"TiDB hint 功能使用和优化\". To cover more ground, I\\'ll change it to include examples and common scenarios, like \"TiDB hint 功能使用和优化，包括示例和常见使用场景\".

This ensures that the generated answer is thorough and addresses potential issues users might face.\\n\\nI also need to make sure that all steps are properly sequenced and that dependencies are handled correctly. The new version-related information will be stored in a variable, which will be included in the context of the final `llm_generate` step.

This command provides information about the status of `ANALYZE` operations, including start and end times, processed rows, and any failure reasons.\\n   - For a more comprehensive history, especially if you are using TiDB v6.1.0 or later, you can query the `mysql.analyze_jobs` system table. This table retains records of `ANALYZE` tasks for the last 7 days, allowing you to see when statistics were last updated.\\n\\n   ```sql\\n   SHOW ANALYZE STATUS;\\n   SELECT * FROM mysql.analyze_jobs WHERE end_time IS NOT NULL ORDER BY end_time DESC;\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Check Table Metadata**:\\n   - Use the `SHOW STATS_META` statement to view metadata about the tables, including the total number of rows and the number of modified rows. This information helps determine if the statistics are up-to-date. A high ratio of modified rows to total rows may indicate that statistics need updating.\\n\\n   ```sql\\n   SHOW STATS_META;\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Run EXPLAIN Before and After ANALYZE**:\\n   - Execute an `EXPLAIN` query on your SQL statement before running `ANALYZE TABLE` to capture the current execution plan.\\n   - After running `ANALYZE TABLE`, execute the same `EXPLAIN` query again to observe any improvements or changes in the query plan. This comparison can highlight how updated statistics have optimized the query execution.\\n\\n   ```sql\\n   EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE your_conditions;\\n   ANALYZE TABLE your_table;\\n   EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE your_conditions;\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Check for Automatic Updates**:\\n   - If you have automatic statistics updates enabled, you can check the system variables like `tidb_auto_analyze_ratio`, `tidb_auto_analyze_start_time`, and `tidb_auto_analyze_end_time` to understand when automatic updates are likely to occur.\\n   - Additionally, you can look at the `SHOW STATS_HEALTHY` command to assess the health of the statistics.

You can use the following SQL command to view this information:\\n\\n```sql\\nSHOW STATS_META;\\n```\\n\\nThis command will return several columns, but the key ones to focus on are:\\n\\n- **`modify_count`**: This column indicates the number of rows that have been modified since the last statistics update.\\n- **`row_count`**: This column shows the total number of rows in the table.\\n\\n### Interpreting `modify_count` and `row_count`\\n\\n- If `modify_count` is significantly high compared to `row_count`, it suggests that many changes have occurred since the last statistics update, and the statistics might be outdated.\\n- A `modify_count` close to zero indicates that there have been few or no changes since the last update, suggesting that the statistics are likely up-to-date.\\n\\n### Step 2: Query the `mysql.analyze_jobs` Table\\n\\nThe `mysql.analyze_jobs` table stores historical records of `ANALYZE` tasks, which are responsible for collecting statistics. You can query this table to check the status and history of these tasks:\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT * FROM mysql.analyze_jobs;\\n```\\n\\nThis query will provide information about past `ANALYZE` tasks, including:\\n\\n- **`Start_time`** and **`End_time`**: These columns show when the `ANALYZE` task started and ended.\\n- **`State`**: This indicates whether the task is `pending`, `running`, `finished`, or `failed`.\\n- **`Fail_reason`**: If a task failed, this column provides the reason.\\n\\n### Verification Process\\n\\n1. **Check Recent `ANALYZE` Tasks**: Look for recent entries in the `mysql.analyze_jobs` table to ensure that `ANALYZE` tasks have been executed recently. A recent `ANALYZE` task with a `finished` state suggests that statistics are up-to-date.\\n\\n2. **Compare `modify_count` and `row_count`**: If the `modify_count` is low relative to the `row_count`, and recent `ANALYZE` tasks have been completed successfully, it is likely that the statistics are current.\\n\\n3. **Use `SHOW ANALYZE STATUS`**: This command can also be used to view the current state of `ANALYZE` tasks and verify their progress and completion status:\\n\\n   ```sql\\n   SHOW ANALYZE STATUS;\\n   ```\\n\\nThis command provides a snapshot of ongoing and recent `ANALYZE` tasks, helping you confirm if statistics are being updated as expected.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the official TiDB documentation on [SHOW STATS_META](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sql-statement-show-stats-meta) and [SHOW ANALYZE STATUS](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sql-statement-show-analyze-status).', 'reasoning': 'Okay, I need to update the plan based on the suggestions provided.

Earlier versions had significant performance issues because each transaction required saving IDs, while newer versions handle this more efficiently in memory.\\n\\n2. **Default Cache Comparison**: The default setting for `AUTO_ID_CACHE` is much higher (e.g., 30,000), so setting it to 1 disables caching.

Here's the revised example and explanation:\\n\\n### Revised Example of Creating a Global Binding\\n\\nSuppose you have a query that joins two tables, `t1` and `t2`, and you want to ensure that the optimizer uses a sort-merge join for this operation. You can create a global binding as follows:\\n\\n```sql\\nCREATE GLOBAL BINDING FOR\\n    SELECT * FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.id = t2.id\\nUSING\\n    SELECT /*+ MERGE_JOIN(t1, t2) */ * FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.id = t2.id;\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation\\n\\n- **Global Binding**: This feature allows you to enforce a specific execution plan for a query across all sessions. In this example, the global binding ensures that whenever the specified query is executed, the optimizer will use the sort-merge join method.\\n  \\n- **Optimizer Hint**: The `MERGE_JOIN(t1, t2)` hint is used to instruct the optimizer to use a sort-merge join for the join operation between `t1` and `t2`. This is embedded within a SQL comment `/*+ ... */` and is part of the `USING` clause in the global binding.\\n\\n- **Consistency**: By using global bindings, you ensure that all users and sessions execute the query with the same optimized plan, which can lead to more predictable performance.\\n\\n- **Best Practices**: Ensure that the SQL statement in the `USING` clause is syntactically correct and that the hints are placed correctly to influence the intended part of the query. This helps in maintaining the effectiveness of the global binding.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on optimizer hints and global bindings in TiDB, you can refer to the official documentation:\\n- [Optimizer Hints](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/optimizer-hints)\\n- [SQL Plan Management](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sql-plan-management)\", 'reasoning': \"Alright, I need to help update the plan based on the user's suggestions.

The plan involved retrieving information about global bindings and optimizer hints, then generating a SQL example using an LLM.\\n\\nThe user's suggestion is to improve the plan by adding a dual retrieval approach to ensure all relevant scenarios are captured and incorporating a verification step. This would make the final answer more comprehensive and accurate.\\n\\nSo, I need to analyze the suggestions and see how they can be integrated into the existing plan without altering the steps up to seq_no 2. The goal is to enhance the plan's thoroughness and ensure the example provided is robust.\\n\\nI'll start by identifying where the new steps can be inserted. Since the current program counter is at step 3, which assigns the final answer, the new steps should come after the existing ones but before the final assignment.\\n\\nThe first addition is a dual retrieval approach. This means using both `retrieve_knowledge_graph` and `vector_search` to gather more comprehensive information. I'll add a step to call `vector_search` with the same query used in `retrieve_knowledge_graph`. This will fetch additional document snippets that might not be covered by the knowledge graph alone.\\n\\nNext, I need to process the outputs from both tools. I'll add a step where the LLM generates a refined explanation by combining the knowledge graph data and the vector search results. This ensures that all relevant information is synthesized into a coherent example.\\n\\nThen, to verify the example's correctness, I'll include a step where the LLM checks the example against best practices and official documentation. This step will help catch any potential issues and ensure the example is accurate.\\n\\nFinally, I'll update the assignment step to include the verified example and explanation, ensuring that the final answer is comprehensive and reliable.\\n\\nI also need to make sure that all variable references are correctly handled and that the sequence numbers are incremented properly. Each new step should have a unique seq_no, starting from where the previous plan left off.\\n\\nBy integrating these changes, the plan becomes more robust, ensuring that all possible scenarios and best practices are considered, and the final example is thoroughly verified.\", 'plan': [{'parameters': {'goal': 'Provide another example of creating a global binding in TiDB, focusing on using a different optimizer hint or scenario to demonstrate the flexibility and application of global bindings in optimizing query performance.'}, 'seq_no': 0, 'type': 'assign'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['global_binding_info'], 'tool_name': 'retrieve_knowledge_graph', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB global binding and optimizer hints'}}, 'seq_no': 1, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['example_and_explanation'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': '${global_binding_info}', 'prompt': 'Using the information on TiDB global binding and optimizer hints, provide a SQL example demonstrating the creation of a global binding with a different optimizer hint or scenario.

However, session bindings can override global bindings within a specific session.\\n- **Normalization**: When creating bindings, ensure that the original and bound SQL statements are equivalent after normalization and hint removal. This ensures that the binding is applied correctly.\\n- **Testing and Verification**: Use the `EXPLAIN` statement to verify that the desired execution plan is being used.

Here's a comprehensive explanation of how to create these bindings, with examples, best practices, and verification methods.\\n\\n### Creating Global Bindings with Optimizer Hints\\n\\n**Global Binding Syntax**:\\nTo create a global binding, you use the `CREATE GLOBAL BINDING` statement. This allows you to specify a preferred execution plan for a SQL statement using optimizer hints. The syntax is as follows:\\n\\n```sql\\nCREATE GLOBAL BINDING FOR\\n    [Original SQL Statement]\\nUSING\\n    [SQL Statement with Hints];\\n```\\n\\n### Examples of Global Bindings\\n\\n1. **Using `MERGE_JOIN` Hint**:\\n   - **Scenario**: You have a query joining two large tables, `orders` and `customers`, and you want to enforce a merge join for better performance due to sorted data.\\n   - **SQL Binding**:\\n     ```sql\\n     CREATE GLOBAL BINDING FOR\\n         SELECT * FROM orders o JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id\\n     USING\\n         SELECT /*+ MERGE_JOIN(o, c) */ * FROM orders o JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id;\\n     ```\\n   - **Implications**: The `MERGE_JOIN` hint directs the optimizer to use a merge join, which can be more efficient if the data is already sorted.\\n\\n2. **Using `HASH_JOIN` Hint**:\\n   - **Scenario**: You want to enforce a hash join for a query joining `products` and `categories` to improve performance.\\n   - **SQL Binding**:\\n     ```sql\\n     CREATE GLOBAL BINDING FOR\\n         SELECT * FROM products p JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.id\\n     USING\\n         SELECT /*+ HASH_JOIN(p, c) */ * FROM products p JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.id;\\n     ```\\n   - **Implications**: The `HASH_JOIN` hint is generally more efficient for large tables compared to nested loop joins.\\n\\n3. **Using `IGNORE_INDEX` Hint**:\\n   - **Scenario**: You want to ignore a specific index in a query on the `sales` table.\\n   - **SQL Binding**:\\n     ```sql\\n     CREATE GLOBAL BINDING FOR\\n         SELECT * FROM sales WHERE sale_date > '2025-01-01'\\n     USING\\n         SELECT /*+ IGNORE_INDEX(s, idx_sale_date) */ * FROM sales WHERE sale_date > '2025-01-01';\\n     ```\\n   - **Implications**: The `IGNORE_INDEX` hint tells the optimizer to ignore the specified index, potentially leading to a more efficient execution plan.\\n\\n### Verification of Bindings\\n\\nTo verify that a binding is in effect, you can use the `EXPLAIN` statement. This will show the execution plan that the optimizer uses for a given query. For example:\\n\\n```sql\\nEXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders o JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id;\\n```\\n\\nThe output should reflect the use of the specified join method (e.g., merge join) if the binding is correctly applied.\\n\\n### Interaction Between GLOBAL and SESSION Bindings\\n\\n- **GLOBAL Bindings**: These apply to all sessions and TiDB processes within a cluster, ensuring consistent execution plans across different instances.\\n- **SESSION Bindings**: These are specific to a session and can override GLOBAL bindings within that session. If a SESSION binding exists for a query, it takes precedence over any GLOBAL binding.\\n\\nTo view the current bindings, you can use:\\n```sql\\nSHOW GLOBAL BINDINGS;\\nSHOW SESSION BINDINGS;\\n```\\n\\n### Best Practices\\n\\n- **Consistency**: Use global bindings to ensure consistent query performance across all sessions.\\n- **Verification**: Regularly verify bindings using `EXPLAIN` to ensure they are applied as expected.\\n- **Session Overrides**: Be aware that session bindings can override global bindings, which can be useful for testing or special cases.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [TiDB documentation on SQL Plan Management](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/sql-plan-management) and the [DROP BINDING statement](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/sql-statement-drop-binding).\", 'reasoning': \"Alright, I need to update the plan based on the suggestions provided.

By creating a global binding, you can enforce a specific execution plan, such as using a hash join, which might be more efficient for certain queries depending on the data distribution and system resources.\\n\\n**Flexibility**: Global bindings provide flexibility in optimizing query performance by allowing database administrators to specify execution plans that override the default behavior of the TiDB optimizer. This is particularly useful when the optimizer's default plan is suboptimal due to complex query structures or specific workload characteristics.\\n\\n**Error Handling**: When creating global bindings, it's important to ensure that the SQL statements used in the binding are syntactically correct and that the specified hints are applicable to the query. TiDB will not throw an error for incorrect hints but will issue a warning if a hint is inapplicable. Therefore, it's crucial to verify the effectiveness of the hints using `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.\\n\\n**Performance Implications**: While global bindings can improve performance by enforcing efficient execution plans, they can also lead to suboptimal performance if the data distribution changes over time. It's important to regularly review and update global bindings to ensure they remain effective as the database evolves.\\n\\n**Updating Global Bindings**: To update a global binding, you can drop the existing binding and create a new one with the desired execution plan. For example:\\n\\n```sql\\n-- Drop the existing global binding.\\nDROP GLOBAL BINDING FOR SELECT * FROM orders o, customers c WHERE o.customer_id = c.id;\\n\\n-- Create a new global binding with a different hint.\\nCREATE GLOBAL BINDING FOR\\n    SELECT * FROM orders o, customers c WHERE o.customer_id = c.id\\nUSING\\n    SELECT /*+ MERGE_JOIN(o, c) */ * FROM orders o, customers c WHERE o.customer_id = c.id;\\n```\\n\\nThis approach allows you to adapt to changes in query performance requirements or data characteristics.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on global bindings and optimizer hints in TiDB, you can refer to the official documentation: [Optimizer Hints](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/optimizer-hints) and [SQL Plan Management](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sql-plan-management).\", 'reasoning': \"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to update the plan based on the suggestions provided. Let me break down the problem step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the current plan. The goal is to provide another example of creating a global binding in TiDB using a different optimizer hint or scenario. The original plan involves retrieving information about global bindings and optimizer hints, then generating an example using an LLM.\\n\\nThe suggestions recommend integrating a dual retrieval approach by adding a 'vector_search' step alongside 'retrieve_knowledge_graph'. This should capture more context and nuances. Additionally, the 'llm_generate' step should validate all retrieved data, covering error handling, performance implications, and updates to global bindings.\\n\\nSo, my task is to modify the plan to include these changes without altering the initial steps (up to seq_no 0).

The prompt should now ask the LLM to validate the data, ensuring the example covers error handling, performance, and updates.\\n\\n3. **Ensure Variable Handling**: Make sure that the output variables from both retrieval steps are correctly referenced in the LLM prompt. This means the LLM will have access to all retrieved information when generating the example.\\n\\n4. **Maintain Plan Structure**: Keep the sequence numbers correct, ensuring each new step is added in the right order. The final answer should still be assigned to 'final_answer'.\\n\\n5. **Avoid Redundancy**: Ensure that the new steps add value without repeating the same tasks as before.\\n\\nNow, considering the VM specifications, I need to make sure that each instruction is correctly formatted, variables are properly referenced, and the final answer is aligned with the goal.\\n\\nI should also check that the new steps don't introduce any dependencies that could cause issues.

This can be particularly useful when the default execution plan chosen by the TiDB optimizer is not optimal for certain queries, and a hash join is known to perform better due to the data distribution or size.\\n\\n### Flexibility and Application of Global Bindings\\n\\nGlobal bindings in TiDB provide a powerful mechanism to influence query execution plans across all sessions and instances within a TiDB cluster. This ensures consistent performance improvements for queries that benefit from specific execution strategies, such as using a particular join method or index.\\n\\n#### Considerations for Error Handling\\n\\nWhen creating global bindings, it is important to ensure that the SQL statements used in the binding are correctly normalized and that the optimizer hints are applicable to the query. If there are syntax errors or if the hints are not applicable, the binding creation will fail. TiDB will typically provide warnings or errors to indicate such issues.\\n\\n#### Performance Implications\\n\\nUsing global bindings can significantly improve query performance by ensuring that the most efficient execution plan is used consistently. However, it is crucial to monitor the performance impact of these bindings, as changes in data distribution or query patterns might necessitate updates to the bindings.\\n\\n#### Updates to Global Bindings\\n\\nGlobal bindings can be updated or removed as needed. If the data characteristics change or if a different execution plan becomes more optimal, you can drop the existing binding and create a new one with updated hints. For example:\\n\\n```sql\\n-- Drop the existing global binding\\nDROP GLOBAL BINDING FOR\\n    SELECT * FROM orders, customers WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.id;\\n\\n-- Create a new global binding with a different hint\\nCREATE GLOBAL BINDING FOR\\n    SELECT * FROM orders, customers WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.id\\nUSING\\n    SELECT /*+ MERGE_JOIN(orders, customers) */ * FROM orders, customers WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.id;\\n```\\n\\nThis flexibility allows database administrators to adapt to changing workloads and optimize query performance continuously.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on SQL Plan Management and optimizer hints in TiDB, you can refer to the official documentation: [SQL Plan Management](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/sql-plan-management) and [Optimizer Hints](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/optimizer-hints).', 'reasoning': \"Alright, I'm trying to update the plan based on the suggestions provided.

This guide assumes you have access to the Kubernetes cluster and the necessary permissions to execute commands.\\n\\n### Step-by-Step Guide for Manual Compaction on TiKV Nodes\\n\\n1. **List All TiKV Pods:**\\n   - First, identify the namespace where your TiDB cluster is deployed. This is typically specified during the deployment of the cluster.\\n   - Use the following command to list all TiKV pods in the specified namespace:\\n     ```shell\\n     kubectl get pods -n <namespace> -l app.kubernetes.io/component=tikv\\n     ```\\n   - This command filters the pods by the label `app.kubernetes.io/component=tikv`, which is commonly used to identify TiKV pods.\\n\\n2. **Access Each TiKV Pod:**\\n   - For each TiKV pod listed, you will need to execute a compaction command. Use the following command to access a TiKV pod:\\n     ```shell\\n     kubectl exec -n <namespace> -it <tikv-pod-name> -- /bin/sh\\n     ```\\n   - Replace `<tikv-pod-name>` with the name of the TiKV pod you want to access.\\n\\n3. **Perform Compaction:**\\n   - Once inside the TiKV pod, you can use the `tikv-ctl` tool to perform manual compaction. Run the following command:\\n     ```shell\\n     tikv-ctl --compact --db=kv --from= --to= --threads=1\\n     ```\\n   - This command will compact the key-value database. You can specify the `--from` and `--to` options to define the range of keys to compact. If you want to compact the entire range, you can leave these options empty.\\n\\n4. **Exit the Pod:**\\n   - After the compaction is complete, exit the shell session of the TiKV pod by typing:\\n     ```shell\\n     exit\\n     ```\\n\\n5. **Repeat for All TiKV Pods:**\\n   - Repeat steps 2 to 4 for each TiKV pod in your cluster to ensure that compaction is performed across all nodes.\\n\\n### Additional Notes\\n\\n- **Monitoring and Verification:**\\n  - After performing compaction, monitor the TiKV logs to verify that the compaction process has completed successfully. You can view the logs using:\\n    ```shell\\n    kubectl logs -n <namespace> <tikv-pod-name>\\n    ```\\n\\n- **Considerations:**\\n  - Manual compaction can be resource-intensive. It is advisable to perform this operation during off-peak hours to minimize the impact on your cluster's performance.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on managing TiDB clusters in Kubernetes, you can refer to the official documentation: [TiDB in Kubernetes Documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/).\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can manually perform compaction on all TiKV nodes in your TiDB cluster deployed on Kubernetes.\", 'reasoning': \"To manually perform compaction on all TiKV nodes in a TiDB cluster deployed on Kubernetes, we need to follow a structured approach. The process involves accessing each TiKV pod and executing the `tikv-ctl` command to perform compaction.

This involves having the necessary permissions and tools (like `kubectl`) to interact with the cluster.\\n\\n2. **Identify TiKV Pods**: We need to list all the TiKV pods in the cluster. This can be done using `kubectl` commands to query the pods running in the namespace where TiDB is deployed.\\n\\n3. **Execute Compaction**: For each TiKV pod, we will execute the `tikv-ctl` command to perform compaction. This requires accessing the pod and running the command inside it.\\n\\n4. **Verify Compaction**: After executing the compaction, we should verify that it was successful. This might involve checking logs or the status of the TiKV nodes.\\n\\n5. **Document the Process**: Finally, we should document the steps and commands used for future reference.\\n\\nGiven the above steps, we will create a plan that involves using `kubectl` to list and access pods, and then executing the necessary commands inside each pod. We will use the `llm_generate` tool to ensure the instructions are clear and concise.\\n\\nThe plan will include:\\n- Using `vector_search` to gather information on how to list and access TiKV pods.\\n- Using `llm_generate` to synthesize the information into a coherent set of instructions.\\n- Assigning the final instructions to the `final_answer` variable.\\n\\nLet's proceed with creating the plan.\", 'plan': [{'parameters': {'output_vars': ['tikv_pod_listing_info'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'How to list all TiKV pods in a TiDB cluster on Kubernetes?', 'top_k': 3}}, 'seq_no': 0, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['pod_command_execution_info'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'How to execute commands inside a Kubernetes pod?', 'top_k': 3}}, 'seq_no': 1, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['compaction_instructions'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': '${tikv_pod_listing_info} ${pod_command_execution_info}', 'prompt': 'Using the information on listing TiKV pods and executing commands inside them, provide a detailed step-by-step guide on how to manually perform compaction on all TiKV nodes in a TiDB cluster deployed on Kubernetes.

This guide includes verifying the cluster status before and after compaction, and explains the significance of the `--from` and `--to` parameters.\\n\\n### Step 1: Verify Kubernetes Context\\nBefore starting, ensure that your kubectl context is set to the correct Kubernetes cluster where your TiDB is deployed. You can verify this by running:\\n\\n```shell\\nkubectl config current-context\\n```\\n\\n### Step 2: Check TiKV Pods\\nList all TiKV pods to ensure they are running. This can be done using:\\n\\n```shell\\nkubectl get pods -n <namespace> -l app.kubernetes.io/component=tikv\\n```\\n\\nReplace `<namespace>` with the namespace where your TiDB cluster is deployed. Ensure all TiKV pods are in the `Running` state.\\n\\n### Step 3: Verify TiKV-CTL Version\\nEnsure that the `tikv-ctl` version matches the TiKV version in your cluster. This is crucial for compatibility. You can check the version by executing:\\n\\n```shell\\nkubectl exec -n <namespace> <tikv-pod-name> -- tikv-ctl --version\\n```\\n\\n### Step 4: Retrieve Cluster Status\\nBefore performing compaction, check the cluster status to ensure it is healthy. Use the following command:\\n\\n```shell\\nkubectl exec -n <namespace> <tidb-pod-name> -- tiup cluster display <cluster-name>\\n```\\n\\nEnsure all components are `Up`.\\n\\n### Step 5: Perform Compaction\\nTo manually compact data on each TiKV node, use the `compact` command. The `--from` and `--to` parameters specify the compaction range in the form of escaped raw keys. If not set, the whole range will be compacted. This is useful for targeting specific data ranges for compaction.\\n\\nFor each TiKV pod, execute:\\n\\n```shell\\nkubectl exec -n <namespace> <tikv-pod-name> -- tikv-ctl --host <tikv-host>:<tikv-port> compact -d kv --from <start-key> --to <end-key>\\n```\\n\\nReplace `<tikv-host>` and `<tikv-port>` with the appropriate values for each TiKV instance. If you want to compact the entire range, omit the `--from` and `--to` options.\\n\\n### Step 6: Verify Cluster Status Post-Compaction\\nAfter compaction, verify the cluster status again to ensure all components are still `Up` and functioning correctly:\\n\\n```shell\\nkubectl exec -n <namespace> <tidb-pod-name> -- tiup cluster display <cluster-name>\\n```\\n\\n### Step 7: Handle Errors\\nIf any errors occur during compaction, check the logs of the TiKV pods for more details:\\n\\n```shell\\nkubectl logs -n <namespace> <tikv-pod-name>\\n```\\n\\n### Significance of `--from` and `--to` Parameters\\nThe `--from` and `--to` parameters allow you to specify a specific range of keys to compact. This can be useful for optimizing specific parts of your data that may be more fragmented or frequently accessed, thus improving performance without the overhead of compacting the entire dataset.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on using `tikv-ctl`, refer to the [TiKV Control User Guide](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tikv-control).\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can effectively manage and optimize your TiKV nodes' performance through manual compaction.\", 'reasoning': \"Okay, so I need to update the plan based on the suggestions provided. Let me go through the suggestions one by one and see how they can be incorporated into the existing plan.\\n\\nFirst, the suggestion mentions adding an initial step to verify the Kubernetes context and namespace. That makes sense because ensuring the correct environment is set up is crucial before proceeding with any commands. Without this step, there's a risk of running commands in the wrong namespace, which could lead to errors or unintended actions.\\n\\nNext, the suggestion is to include a step that verifies the version of tikv-ctl being used. This is important because different versions of tikv-ctl might have variations in command syntax or features. Knowing the version ensures that the compaction command is compatible and effective.\\n\\nAdditionally, the suggestion recommends retrieving the cluster status before and after compaction. This step helps in verifying whether the compaction was successful. By comparing the statuses, we can confirm if the compaction process made the necessary changes and if the cluster is functioning as expected.\\n\\nThe suggestion also points out the need for error handling guidance. It's essential to include what to do if the compaction command fails or if pods are unreachable. This could involve retrying commands, checking logs, or troubleshooting network issues. Providing such guidance makes the plan more robust and user-friendly.\\n\\nAnother suggestion is to add a note about dual retrieval using vector_search and retrieve_knowledge_graph. This ensures comprehensive coverage of information, especially in environments where detailed documentation or specific knowledge is required. By combining both tools, the plan can gather a richer set of data to inform the compaction process.\\n\\nLastly, the suggestion recommends explaining the significance of the --from and --to parameters in the tikv-ctl command. This helps users tailor the compaction to their specific needs, ensuring that it's applied to the correct range of data and optimizing the process for their use case.\\n\\nNow, looking at the current plan, it starts by listing TiKV pods and then executing commands inside them. The final step uses llm_generate to provide instructions. To incorporate the suggestions, I need to add new steps before the final llm_generate call.\\n\\nI'll start by adding a step to verify the Kubernetes context and namespace. This can be done using vector_search to gather information on how to check the current context and namespace in Kubernetes. Then, I'll add another step to check the tikv-ctl version by searching for the appropriate command. \\n\\nNext, I'll include a step to retrieve the cluster status before compaction. This involves searching for commands that display the current status of the TiDB cluster.

This guide will help you execute the compaction process and verify its success. Additionally, consult the official documentation for further troubleshooting and additional options.\\n\\n### Step-by-Step Guide for TiKV Compaction\\n\\n1. **List TiKV Pods**:\\n   - First, identify all the TiKV pods in your Kubernetes cluster. Use the following command to list the pods:\\n     ```shell\\n     kubectl get pods -n ${namespace} -l app.kubernetes.io/component=tikv\\n     ```\\n   - Replace `${namespace}` with the namespace where your TiDB cluster is deployed.\\n\\n2. **Execute Compaction Command**:\\n   - For each TiKV pod, execute the compaction command. You can perform compaction in remote mode using `tikv-ctl`. Here’s an example command:\\n     ```shell\\n     tikv-ctl --host ${pod_ip}:20160 compact -d kv\\n     ```\\n   - Replace `${pod_ip}` with the IP address of each TiKV pod. You can find the IP address from the output of the previous command.\\n\\n3. **Check Exit Codes**:\\n   - After executing the compaction command, check the exit code to ensure it was successful. A successful execution typically returns an exit code of `0`:\\n     ```shell\\n     echo $?\\n     ```\\n\\n4. **Review TiKV Logs**:\\n   - Access the logs of each TiKV pod to ensure there are no errors or warnings related to the compaction process. Use the following command to view logs:\\n     ```shell\\n     kubectl -n ${namespace} logs ${pod_name} -f\\n     ```\\n   - Replace `${pod_name}` with the name of each TiKV pod.\\n\\n5. **Verify Compaction Results**:\\n   - Verify the compaction by checking the metrics or status of the TiKV nodes. This might involve using monitoring tools or dashboards that track TiKV performance and health.\\n\\n6. **Consistency Check (Optional)**:\\n   - If needed, perform a consistency check to ensure data integrity post-compaction. Be cautious as this might interfere with garbage collection processes in TiDB.\\n\\n### Additional Resources\\n\\nFor more detailed information on executing commands inside TiKV pods and managing TiDB clusters, refer to the following resources:\\n- [TiDB in Kubernetes Documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/)\\n- [TiKV Control User Guide](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/tikv-control)\\n\\nThese steps should help ensure that the compaction process is executed successfully and that the TiKV cluster remains in a healthy state.

Use the following command to view the logs:\\n     ```shell\\n     kubectl logs <tikv-pod-name> -n <namespace>\\n     ```\\n   - Look for log entries that confirm the completion of the compaction process or any error messages that might indicate issues.\\n\\n4. **Check Metrics and Status**:\\n   - If you have monitoring set up, such as using Prometheus and Grafana, review the metrics related to TiKV compaction. Metrics like `tikv_compaction_duration_seconds` can provide insights into the duration and success of compaction operations.\\n\\n5. **Verify Data Integrity**:\\n   - After compaction, perform data integrity checks to ensure that the data is consistent and there are no missing entries.

For example, in financial systems where transaction IDs need to be sequential for auditing purposes, or in systems where the order of operations is critical, sequential primary keys are necessary.\\n\\nHowever, using sequential primary keys in a distributed database like TiDB can lead to write hotspots. This is because consecutive IDs tend to be written to the same storage node, causing uneven distribution of write operations and potentially leading to performance bottlenecks.\\n\\n### Scenarios Where Sequential Primary Keys Can Be Avoided\\n\\nIn many cases, the need for sequential primary keys can be avoided, especially when the primary goal is to ensure uniqueness rather than order. In such scenarios, using non-sequential keys like those generated by the `AUTO_RANDOM` feature can be beneficial. `AUTO_RANDOM` assigns unique, random values to primary key columns, which helps distribute write operations more evenly across storage nodes, thus mitigating write hotspots.\\n\\n### Implications of Using AUTO_RANDOM\\n\\nThe `AUTO_RANDOM` feature in TiDB is particularly useful for avoiding write hotspots caused by sequential primary keys. By generating random and unique primary key values, `AUTO_RANDOM` ensures that write operations are spread across different storage nodes, leading to improved performance and reduced contention.\\n\\nFor example, when creating a table with an `AUTO_RANDOM` primary key, you might use the following SQL statement:\\n\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE t (a BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_RANDOM, b VARCHAR(255));\\n```\\n\\nIn this setup, if you insert data without specifying the primary key, TiDB will automatically generate a random value for the primary key, thus distributing the data more evenly across the cluster.\\n\\n### Example and Impact\\n\\nConsider a scenario where you have a table with a primary key defined as `AUTO_INCREMENT`. This setup might lead to a hotspot on a single storage node due to the sequential nature of the IDs. By switching to `AUTO_RANDOM`, as shown in the example above, you can scatter the write load across multiple nodes, reducing the risk of hotspots and improving overall system performance.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on handling write hotspots and using `AUTO_RANDOM` in TiDB, you can refer to the official documentation: [Troubleshoot Hotspot Issues](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/troubleshoot-hot-spot-issues).\\n\\nIn summary, while sequential primary keys are necessary in some scenarios, they can often be avoided in favor of non-sequential keys like those generated by `AUTO_RANDOM`, especially in distributed systems like TiDB where performance and scalability are critical.', 'reasoning': \"To address the goal of understanding when sequential primary keys are required versus when they can be avoided in TiDB, particularly in the context of TiDB's `AUTO_RANDOM` feature and its impact on write hotspots, we need to follow a structured approach:\\n\\n1. **Break Down the Goal**:\\n   - Identify scenarios where sequential primary keys are necessary.\\n   - Identify scenarios where sequential primary keys can be avoided.\\n   - Understand the implications of using `AUTO_RANDOM` in TiDB and how it affects performance and data distribution.\\n\\n2. **Information Retrieval**:\\n   - Use the `retrieve_knowledge_graph` tool to gather structured information about primary keys in TiDB, focusing on sequential and non-sequential keys.\\n   - Use the `vector_search` tool to find detailed documentation or discussions about the use of primary keys and the `AUTO_RANDOM` feature in TiDB.\\n\\n3. **Synthesize Information**:\\n   - Use the `llm_generate` tool to synthesize the information from the knowledge graph and document snippets to provide a comprehensive answer.\\n\\n4. **Plan Structure**:\\n   - Start with a reasoning step to outline the approach.\\n   - Use `retrieve_knowledge_graph` and `vector_search` to gather information.\\n   - Use `llm_generate` to synthesize and generate the final answer.\\n\\n5. **Dependencies**:\\n   - The synthesis step depends on the information gathered from the knowledge graph and vector search.\\n\\nBy following this approach, we ensure a comprehensive understanding of the scenarios and implications related to primary keys in TiDB.\", 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': 'To understand when sequential primary keys are required versus when they can be avoided in TiDB, we will: 1.

For example, in financial systems, transaction IDs are typically sequential to ensure that transactions are processed in the correct order. This ordering is essential for maintaining the integrity and consistency of financial records. Sequential keys can also simplify certain types of queries and reporting tasks that rely on the natural order of data.\\n\\n**Pros of Sequential Primary Keys:**\\n- **Order Preservation**: Ensures that data is stored and retrieved in a predictable order, which is beneficial for applications that require chronological processing.\\n- **Simplicity**: Easier to implement and understand, especially in systems where order is a natural part of the data model.\\n\\n**Cons of Sequential Primary Keys:**\\n- **Write Hotspots**: In distributed systems like TiDB, sequential keys can lead to write hotspots, where a single node becomes a bottleneck because it handles all the writes for new rows. This can degrade performance and scalability.\\n\\n### Scenarios for Using AUTO_RANDOM\\n\\nThe `AUTO_RANDOM` feature in TiDB is designed to mitigate the write hotspot issue by distributing writes more evenly across the cluster. This feature is particularly useful in high-concurrency environments where many transactions are processed simultaneously, such as in large-scale web applications or IoT systems.\\n\\n**Pros of AUTO_RANDOM:**\\n- **Mitigates Hotspots**: By generating random and unique primary keys, `AUTO_RANDOM` helps distribute writes across multiple nodes, improving performance and scalability.\\n- **Improved Concurrency**: Supports high-concurrency workloads by reducing contention on a single node.\\n\\n**Cons of AUTO_RANDOM:**\\n- **Complexity**: The randomness of keys can make certain types of queries less efficient, particularly those that benefit from ordered data.\\n- **Explicit Insertion Limitations**: By default, you cannot explicitly insert values into an `AUTO_RANDOM` column unless you change the configuration by setting `@@allow_auto_random_explicit_insert` to true. This can complicate data migration and integration tasks.\\n\\n### Real-World Example\\n\\nConsider a high-traffic e-commerce platform that needs to handle thousands of transactions per second. Using `AUTO_RANDOM` for order IDs can help distribute the load across the database cluster, preventing any single node from becoming a bottleneck. This setup ensures that the system remains responsive even under heavy load.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a banking application that processes transactions in a specific order might opt for sequential primary keys to maintain the integrity of transaction sequences. In this case, the application might need to implement additional strategies to manage write hotspots, such as sharding or using a more sophisticated load balancing mechanism.\\n\\n### Limitations and Considerations\\n\\nWhile `AUTO_RANDOM` is effective in reducing write hotspots, it comes with limitations. For instance, you cannot use `ALTER TABLE` to switch from `AUTO_INCREMENT` to `AUTO_RANDOM` if the maximum value is close to the column type's limit. Additionally, once `AUTO_RANDOM` is used, reverting to `AUTO_INCREMENT` can be challenging due to potentially large auto-generated values.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on `AUTO_RANDOM` and its use cases, you can refer to the official TiDB documentation: [AUTO_RANDOM](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/auto-random).\\n\\nIn summary, the choice between sequential and non-sequential primary keys in TiDB should be guided by the specific needs of your application, considering factors like transaction ordering requirements and the need to mitigate write hotspots in high-concurrency environments.\", 'reasoning': \"Alright, so I need to update the plan based on the user's suggestions.

These systems rely on the predictability and order of IDs to ensure that records can be traced and verified in the exact sequence they were created. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity and compliance with regulatory standards.\\n\\n2. **Legacy Systems Compatibility**: Some legacy systems or applications might be designed with the assumption that primary keys are sequential. In such cases, using sequential keys can simplify integration and data migration processes.\\n\\n### Scenarios Where Sequential Primary Keys Can Be Avoided\\n\\n1. **High-Write Distributed Workloads**: In distributed databases like TiDB, using sequential primary keys can lead to write hotspots. This occurs because consecutive IDs are often written to the same storage node, causing uneven distribution of write operations. In such scenarios, using `AUTO_RANDOM` can help distribute writes more evenly across nodes, reducing the risk of hotspots and improving overall system performance.\\n\\n2. **Applications with No Strict Order Requirement**: For applications where the order of record creation is not critical, non-sequential keys can be used. This is often the case in systems where the primary key is used solely as a unique identifier without any inherent meaning or order.\\n\\n### Implications of Using AUTO_RANDOM\\n\\nThe `AUTO_RANDOM` feature in TiDB is designed to automatically assign unique, random values to primary key columns. This approach helps mitigate write hotspots by distributing writes across multiple storage nodes. It is particularly beneficial in high-concurrency environments where write operations are frequent and need to be balanced across the cluster.\\n\\nFor example, in a high-write distributed workload, switching from `AUTO_INCREMENT` to `AUTO_RANDOM` can significantly reduce the likelihood of write hotspots. This is because `AUTO_RANDOM` generates non-sequential IDs, which are less likely to be concentrated on a single node. As a result, the workload is more evenly distributed, leading to better performance and scalability.\\n\\n### Example and Documentation Insights\\n\\nConsider a scenario where a table is created with an `AUTO_RANDOM` primary key:\\n\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE t (a BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_RANDOM, b VARCHAR(255));\\n```\\n\\nIn this setup, TiDB automatically assigns random values to the `a` column, ensuring that writes are distributed across the cluster. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where the application does not require sequential IDs and can benefit from improved write performance.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on the use of `AUTO_RANDOM` and its impact on write hotspots, you can refer to the TiDB documentation on [AUTO_RANDOM](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/auto-random) and [troubleshooting hotspot issues](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/troubleshoot-hot-spot-issues).\\n\\nBy understanding the specific needs of your application and leveraging features like `AUTO_RANDOM`, you can optimize your TiDB deployment for both performance and scalability.', 'reasoning': 'Alright, I\\'m trying to figure out how to update the plan based on the suggestions provided.

Here's a breakdown of when each approach is suitable and the implications of using `AUTO_RANDOM`:\\n\\n### Scenarios Requiring Sequential Primary Keys\\n\\n1. **Business Logic Dependence**: \\n   - If your application logic relies heavily on the continuity and order of primary key values, sequential primary keys are necessary.\\n   - Example: Invoice numbers or order IDs that need to be sequential for business processes.\\n\\n2. **Data Migration Compatibility**:\\n   - When migrating from systems that use sequential keys, maintaining this order might be crucial for consistency and compatibility.\\n\\n3. **Legacy Systems**:\\n   - Systems that have been designed with the assumption of sequential keys might require this to avoid extensive refactoring.\\n\\n### Scenarios Where Sequential Primary Keys Can Be Avoided\\n\\n1. **Write-Intensive Applications**:\\n   - In distributed databases like TiDB, using sequential keys can lead to write hotspots, where a single node becomes a bottleneck due to concentrated write operations.\\n   - `AUTO_RANDOM` can be used to distribute writes more evenly across nodes, reducing the risk of hotspots.\\n\\n2. **Scalability and Performance**:\\n   - Applications that prioritize scalability and performance over the order of keys can benefit from `AUTO_RANDOM`, which helps in distributing the load and improving write throughput.\\n\\n3. **Non-Sequential Business Requirements**:\\n   - If the business logic does not require sequential keys, using `AUTO_RANDOM` can simplify schema design and improve performance.\\n\\n### Implications of Using `AUTO_RANDOM`\\n\\n- **Write Hotspots**: \\n  - `AUTO_RANDOM` helps mitigate write hotspots by generating random, unique keys, which distribute writes across multiple storage nodes.\\n  - This is particularly beneficial in scenarios with high write concurrency.\\n\\n- **Performance Trade-offs**:\\n  - **Pros**: \\n    - Reduces the likelihood of write hotspots.\\n    - Improves write performance by balancing the load across nodes.\\n  - **Cons**: \\n    - Keys are non-sequential, which might not be suitable for all applications.\\n    - Requires changes in application logic if sequential keys were previously assumed.\\n\\n### Example Comparison\\n\\n| Scenario | Recommended Key Type | Pros | Cons |\\n|----------|----------------------|------|------|\\n| Business logic requires sequential keys | Sequential (AUTO_INCREMENT) | Maintains order and continuity | Potential for write hotspots |\\n| High write concurrency without order requirement | Non-sequential (AUTO_RANDOM) | Avoids hotspots, improves performance | Non-sequential keys, may require application changes |\\n\\nFor more detailed information on using `AUTO_RANDOM` and its impact on write hotspots, you can refer to the following sources:\\n- [AUTO_RANDOM in TiDB](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/auto-random)\\n- [Troubleshoot Hotspot Issues](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/troubleshoot-hot-spot-issues)\\n- [Highly Concurrent Write Best Practices](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/high-concurrency-best-practices)\", 'reasoning': \"Alright, I'm trying to help update the plan based on the user's suggestions. Let me break down the problem and see how I can approach it.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the current plan. The goal is to explain scenarios where sequential primary keys are required versus when they can be avoided in TiDB, especially considering the `AUTO_RANDOM` feature. The existing plan involves using `retrieve_knowledge_graph` and `vector_search` to gather information and then using `llm_generate` to synthesize the answer.\\n\\nThe user suggested adding a step to gather real-world case studies or benchmarks. They also recommended modifying the existing steps to use more specific queries and enhancing the final answer with structured data like bullet points or tables.\\n\\nSo, the main points to address are:\\n\\n1. **Add a Step for Case Studies**: This will provide practical examples and validate the theoretical information gathered earlier. I'll use `vector_search` with a query focusing on real-world use cases and benchmarks.\\n\\n2. **Modify Existing Queries**: Make the queries in `retrieve_knowledge_graph` and `vector_search` more specific to include terms like 'TiDB performance benchmarks' and 'real-world use cases'. This should yield more comprehensive and relevant data.\\n\\n3. **Enhance Final Answer Structure**: The `llm_generate` step should be updated to include structured bullet points or a comparison table. This will make the answer more organized and easier to understand.\\n\\nNow, considering the VM specifications, each instruction must have a unique `seq_no`, and variables must be properly referenced. I'll need to add a new step after the existing `vector_search` to fetch case studies. Then, update the `llm_generate` step to process all gathered information, including the new case studies, and structure the answer accordingly.\\n\\nI should ensure that each tool's output is stored in appropriate variables and that the final `llm_generate` instruction references all necessary variables. Also, the final answer must be stored in a variable named `final_answer` as per the guidelines.\\n\\nPotential issues to consider:\\n\\n- **Variable References**: Make sure that all variables used in `tool_params` are correctly referenced and have been defined in previous steps.\\n\\n- **Query Specificity**: Ensuring that the queries are specific enough to retrieve relevant information without being too narrow.\\n\\n- **Output Structure**: The `llm_generate` prompt must clearly instruct the model to include structured elements, such as bullet points or tables, to enhance readability.\\n\\nBy addressing these points, the updated plan should provide a more comprehensive and well-structured answer, aligning with the user's suggestions and the VM's requirements.\", 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': 'To understand when sequential primary keys are required versus when they can be avoided in TiDB, we will: 1.

Here is a detailed recommendation based on the summarized hardware specifications:\\n\\n### CPU and Memory\\n- **TiDB Nodes**: For production environments, each TiDB node should have at least 16 vCPUs and 48 GB of RAM. To ensure high availability, configure at least two TiDB nodes per cluster. This setup helps manage SQL processing efficiently.\\n- **TiKV Nodes**: TiKV nodes, which handle storage, require more resources. Each node should have at least 16 vCPUs and 64 GB of RAM. This configuration supports the high CPU and memory demands of TiKV.\\n- **TiFlash Nodes**: Depending on your workload and data replication needs, TiFlash nodes can be configured with 8 vCPUs and 64 GiB RAM, up to 32 vCPUs and 256 GiB RAM. This flexibility allows for tailored performance based on specific use cases.\\n\\n### Storage\\n- **TiKV and TiFlash**: Use SSDs to ensure high I/O performance. For TiKV, keep the disk size within 4 TB for PCIe SSDs or 1.5 TB for regular SSDs to maintain optimal performance.\\n- **AWS EBS**: The `gp3` volume type is recommended for its performance benefits. Ensure specific provisioning for TiKV and TiFlash to achieve adequate throughput and IOPS.\\n\\n### Network\\n- **Network Cards**: Utilize 10 Gigabit network cards, preferably bonded, to ensure stable and fast data transmission. This is critical for the performance of distributed systems like TiDB.\\n\\n### AWS-Specific Details\\n- **Instance Types**: \\n  - Use `c7g.xlarge` for PD nodes, which manage metadata and require consistent performance.\\n  - For TiDB nodes, `c7g.4xlarge` is recommended to handle SQL processing efficiently.\\n  - TiKV and TiFlash nodes can benefit from `m7g.4xlarge` instances, providing the necessary resources for storage and analytical processing.\\n- **Availability Zones**: Distribute TiFlash nodes evenly across different availability zones within a region to enhance high availability and fault tolerance.\\n- **Terraform and EKS Compatibility**: TiDB can be deployed using Terraform scripts for automation, and it is compatible with AWS EKS for Kubernetes-based deployments.

Secara default, GC lifetime diatur selama 10 menit. Namun, durasi ini dapat disesuaikan sesuai kebutuhan, misalnya selama proses ekspor atau impor data yang besar, untuk mencegah penghapusan data yang terlalu cepat. Dengan memperpanjang GC lifetime, kita dapat menghindari kehilangan data selama tugas replikasi, meskipun ini dapat menyebabkan peningkatan penggunaan penyimpanan dan potensi dampak pada kinerja, terutama untuk kueri rentang.\\n\\nSafe point dalam TiDB adalah sebuah penanda waktu yang dihitung oleh proses GC. Safe point ini menandai batas waktu sebelum data dianggap aman untuk dihapus. Proses GC berjalan secara berkala, biasanya setiap 10 menit, dan menggunakan safe point untuk menentukan data mana yang dapat dihapus dengan aman. Safe point ini penting untuk menjaga konsistensi transaksi yang sedang berlangsung dan memastikan bahwa tidak ada data yang diperlukan dihapus sebelum waktunya.\\n\\nBerikut adalah beberapa contoh skenario yang menggambarkan pentingnya safe point meskipun GC lifetime diatur ke 10 menit:\\n\\n1. **Transaksi Jangka Panjang**: Misalkan ada transaksi yang dimulai untuk menjalankan kueri analitis yang kompleks dan memakan waktu lama. Jika GC lifetime diatur ke durasi yang pendek, seperti 10 menit, transaksi tersebut mungkin masih berjalan ketika proses GC dipicu. Safe point memastikan bahwa versi data historis yang dibutuhkan oleh transaksi ini tidak dihapus sebelum waktunya, sehingga transaksi dapat diselesaikan dengan sukses tanpa kehilangan data.\\n\\n2. **Operasi Ekspor Data**: Selama operasi ekspor data yang besar, seperti mengekspor sebagian besar database untuk keperluan backup atau migrasi, proses ini mungkin memakan waktu lebih lama dari GC lifetime default. Dengan menetapkan safe point, TiDB memastikan bahwa semua versi data yang dibutuhkan untuk ekspor dipertahankan hingga operasi selesai, mencegah inkonsistensi atau kehilangan data.\\n\\n3. **Replikasi dan Backup**: Dalam lingkungan database terdistribusi, proses replikasi dan backup mungkin memerlukan akses ke versi data historis untuk memastikan konsistensi antar node. Safe point bertindak sebagai pengaman, memastikan bahwa proses ini dapat mengakses versi data yang diperlukan meskipun proses GC dipicu selama eksekusi mereka.\\n\\n4. **Konsistensi dalam Transaksi Terdistribusi**: Dalam transaksi terdistribusi yang melibatkan beberapa node atau kluster, menjaga konsistensi sangat penting. Safe point memastikan bahwa semua node memiliki akses ke versi data historis yang sama, mencegah node mana pun menghapus data yang mungkin masih dibutuhkan oleh node lain yang terlibat dalam transaksi.\\n\\nSkenario-skenario ini menyoroti pentingnya safe point dalam menjaga integritas dan konsistensi data, terutama dalam operasi yang melampaui GC lifetime yang tipikal.

Secara default, periode retensi ini diatur selama 10 menit. Artinya, data yang lebih tua dari GC lifetime dianggap tidak lagi diperlukan untuk konsistensi transaksi dan dapat dihapus untuk menghemat ruang penyimpanan.\\n\\nNamun, meskipun GC lifetime diatur ke 10 menit, konsep safe point tetap penting. Safe point adalah penanda waktu yang dihitung sebagai waktu saat ini dikurangi dengan GC lifetime. Data yang lebih tua dari safe point dianggap aman untuk dihapus. Safe point memastikan bahwa semua transaksi yang mungkin memerlukan akses ke versi data yang lebih lama telah selesai sebelum data tersebut dihapus.\\n\\nBerikut adalah beberapa contoh skenario yang menggambarkan pentingnya safe point:\\n\\n### Transaksi Panjang\\n\\nDalam skenario di mana transaksi berlangsung lama, safe point memastikan bahwa versi historis data tetap tersedia hingga transaksi selesai. Ini penting karena transaksi panjang mungkin memerlukan akses ke versi data yang lebih lama untuk menjaga konsistensi. Jika proses GC menghapus versi ini terlalu cepat, dapat menyebabkan ketidakkonsistenan atau kegagalan transaksi. Dengan mengatur `tidb_gc_life_time` yang sesuai, safe point dapat disesuaikan untuk mengakomodasi durasi transaksi ini, mencegah kehilangan data.\\n\\n### Ekspor Data\\n\\nSaat mengekspor data, alat seperti Dumpling mungkin memerlukan akses ke data historis untuk memastikan snapshot database yang konsisten. Selama proses ini, TiDB dapat secara otomatis menyesuaikan safe point GC untuk mencegah pengumpulan data yang mungkin masih diperlukan untuk ekspor. Penyesuaian ini memastikan bahwa data tetap tersedia selama proses ekspor, bahkan jika melebihi GC lifetime yang biasa. Mekanisme ini penting untuk menjaga integritas data selama ekspor.\\n\\n### Replikasi\\n\\nDalam skenario replikasi, seperti menggunakan TiCDC untuk mereplikasi data ke sistem hilir, safe point berperan penting dalam memastikan bahwa semua data yang diperlukan untuk replikasi tersedia. Jika proses replikasi tertunda atau jika ada transaksi besar yang terlibat, safe point memastikan bahwa data yang diperlukan untuk replikasi tidak dikumpulkan terlalu cepat oleh proses GC. Ini sangat penting untuk menjaga konsistensi antara data sumber dan data yang direplikasi.\\n\\nUntuk informasi lebih lanjut tentang mekanisme GC dan konfigurasinya, Anda dapat merujuk ke sumber berikut:\\n- [GC Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/garbage-collection-overview)\\n- [Timeouts in TiDB](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/dev-guide-timeouts-in-tidb)\\n- [Delete Data Performance Considerations](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/dev-guide-delete-data)', 'reasoning': \"Okay, so I need to update the plan based on the user's suggestions and the current execution state.

Here are the key limitations:\\n\\n1. **DDL Operations**: TiCDC does not automatically replicate DDL (Data Definition Language) statements in a bidirectional setup. This means that any changes to the database schema, such as creating or dropping tables, must be manually executed on both clusters. Only certain DDL operations can be performed without halting application write operations, such as altering table comments or managing partitions and indexes. For unsupported DDL operations, you must pause writes, execute the DDL on all clusters, and then resume writes. More details can be found in the [TiCDC Bidirectional Replication documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/ticdc-bidirectional-replication).\\n\\n2. **Write Conflicts**: The system does not automatically detect write conflicts between the clusters. This can lead to undefined behaviors if conflicting writes occur. It is essential to ensure that the application logic prevents such conflicts to maintain data consistency.\\n\\n3. **Cascading Mode**: TiCDC does not support cascading replication, where data flows through multiple clusters in a chain (e.g., TiDB A -> TiDB B -> TiDB C -> TiDB A). Such a setup can lead to disruptions if one cluster fails. Instead, each cluster should be directly connected to every other cluster (e.g., TiDB A <-> TiDB B, TiDB B <-> TiDB C, TiDB C <-> TiDB A) to ensure redundancy and reliability.\\n\\n4. **Transaction Splitting**: TiCDC has partial support for large transactions. Transactions exceeding 5 GB can cause increased replication latency or memory issues. TiCDC can split single-table transactions into multiple transactions to alleviate these problems, but this may compromise transaction atomicity, potentially affecting data integrity.\\n\\n5. **Version-Specific Restrictions**: Certain features and configurations are specific to particular versions of TiCDC. For instance, starting from version 6.2.0, the `cdc cli` can interact directly with the TiCDC server via the Open API, and the `--pd` parameter is deprecated. Additionally, from version 6.4.0 onwards, only changefeeds with specific privileges can use the TiCDC Syncpoint feature. For more details on compatibility, refer to the [TiCDC Compatibility documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.1/ticdc-compatibility).\\n\\nThese limitations underscore the importance of thorough planning and configuration when implementing bidirectional replication with TiCDC in TiDB environments.

When the pull-based sink is enabled, these issues can become more pronounced, leading to increased latency and resource consumption. This can affect the overall efficiency and speed of data replication, especially in high-load environments or when dealing with large volumes of data.\\n\\n2. **Advanced Error Handling**: TiCDC may encounter errors such as `ErrBufferReachLimit`, which occur when its internal processing capacity is exceeded or when the downstream throughput is insufficient. These errors can lead to out-of-memory (OOM) situations or increased replication latency, particularly when processing large transactions. Effective error handling strategies are essential to mitigate these risks and ensure smooth replication.\\n\\n3. **DDL Replication Challenges**: In bidirectional replication, TiCDC differentiates between replicable and non-replicable DDLs. Replicable DDLs can be executed and propagated across clusters, but non-replicable DDLs, which might lead to data inconsistencies, require manual execution on each cluster. This adds complexity to managing schema changes and requires careful planning to maintain consistency across clusters.\\n\\n4. **Operational Complexities**: Setting up and managing bidirectional replication involves several operational challenges. Proper configuration of BDR roles (`PRIMARY` and `SECONDARY`) is crucial to ensure correct DDL replication. Additionally, managing auto-increment settings to prevent data conflicts and ensuring no write conflicts from the application side are vital for maintaining data consistency. These tasks can be complex, especially in large-scale or geo-distributed deployments.\\n\\n5. **Limitations in Scenarios**: TiCDC does not support certain scenarios, such as using RawKV alone or performing TiDB Lightning physical imports on tables being replicated. These limitations can restrict the use cases where TiCDC can be effectively deployed, necessitating alternative strategies for data replication in these scenarios.\\n\\n6. **Complexity in Stopping Replication**: Halting bidirectional replication requires careful coordination to ensure data consistency across clusters. This involves inserting special records and verifying consistency before stopping the replication process, which can be complex and time-consuming.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on these limitations and strategies to address them, you can refer to the official documentation: [TiCDC Bidirectional Replication](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/ticdc-bidirectional-replication) and [TiCDC Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/ticdc-overview).', 'reasoning': \"Okay, so I need to help update the plan based on the suggestions provided.

Replicable DDLs can be executed and replicated across clusters, but non-replicable DDLs, which might lead to data inconsistencies, require manual execution on each cluster.

But I think using an assign step makes it clearer.\\n\\nSo, in the plan, after step 2, I add a step to assign a variable that combines the knowledge and examples. Then, in the llm_generate step, I use this variable as context and include the specific limitations in the prompt.\\n\\nI also need to make sure that the final answer variable is correctly set.\\n\\nAnother consideration is whether to add another llm_generate step to ensure all specific points are covered.

It is essential to ensure that both clusters involved in the replication are running compatible versions of TiDB and TiCDC. Downgrading TiCDC to versions earlier than 6.1.0 is not possible when certain features, such as `dispatchers.topic` and `dispatchers.partition`, are enabled. For more details, refer to the [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-6.1.0).\\n\\n2. **Performance Concerns**: TiCDC may experience performance issues related to CPU usage, memory control, and throughput, particularly when the pull-based sink is enabled. These issues can affect the efficiency of data replication and should be closely monitored. More information can be found in the [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-6.6.0).\\n\\n3. **Error Handling**: During replication, TiCDC might encounter errors such as `[CDC:ErrBufferReachLimit]`, which can interrupt the replication process. To mitigate such issues, enabling the unified sorter feature or using the BR tool for incremental backup and restore is recommended. For troubleshooting, see the [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/troubleshoot-ticdc).\\n\\n4. **Latency**: TiCDC aims to provide low-latency replication, with second-level Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and minute-level Recovery Time Objective (RTO). However, network isolation or other disruptions can impact latency. Features like the PD client forwarding function have been introduced to improve stability during such events. Additional details are available in the [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-7.5.2).\\n\\n5. **Data Consistency**: TiCDC ensures eventual consistency of data replication. It maintains the order of single-row updates consistent with the upstream but does not guarantee that downstream transactions are executed in the same order as upstream transactions. Enabling the redo log feature can help ensure eventual consistency. For an overview, refer to the [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/ticdc-overview).\\n\\n6. **Configuration Incompatibility**: Upgrading TiCDC can lead to incompatibility issues with configuration files. It is important to review compatibility notes and adjust configurations accordingly to prevent disruptions in replication tasks. For troubleshooting guidance, see the [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/troubleshoot-ticdc).\\n\\nBy understanding these limitations and taking appropriate measures, users can effectively manage bidirectional data replication using TiCDC in TiDB environments.', 'reasoning': \"Okay, I need to update the plan based on the suggestions provided.

Monitoring system resources and optimizing configurations are essential to maintain desired performance levels.\\n\\n2. **Version Compatibility**: Bidirectional replication is supported starting from TiDB version 6.5.0. It is crucial to ensure that both TiDB clusters involved in the replication are running compatible versions to prevent compatibility issues. For more information, refer to the [TiCDC Bidirectional Replication documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/ticdc-bidirectional-replication).\\n\\n3. **Error Handling**: TiCDC includes mechanisms to handle errors during replication, such as retrying failed operations. However, some errors, particularly those related to network issues or configuration mismatches, may require manual intervention to resolve.\\n\\n4. **Latency**: Although TiCDC aims to provide low-latency replication, factors like network speed and the processing power of the clusters involved can introduce delays. Proper configuration of TiCDC is necessary to minimize latency.\\n\\n5. **Data Consistency**: TiCDC ensures eventual consistency between replicated clusters. However, during network partitions or failures, temporary inconsistencies may occur. It is important to have a strategy in place to resolve these inconsistencies once connectivity is restored.\\n\\n6. **Conflict Resolution**: In bidirectional replication, conflicts can occur when the same data is modified in both clusters simultaneously. TiCDC does not automatically resolve such conflicts, necessitating the implementation of application-level conflict resolution strategies.\\n\\n7. **Handling Simultaneous Data Flows**: Managing data flows in both directions can be complex. Careful planning and configuration of replication tasks are required to avoid bottlenecks and ensure the system can handle the load effectively.\\n\\n8. **Potential Data Divergence**: Without proper conflict resolution and consistency checks, there is a risk of data divergence between clusters. Regular audits and consistency checks are recommended to identify and rectify any discrepancies.\\n\\nFor further details on TiCDC and its capabilities, you can refer to the [TiCDC Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/ticdc-overview) and [TiCDC Compatibility](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/ticdc-compatibility) documentation.

They want to include collecting specific configuration details like TiDB's config files, TiUP cluster settings, and network interface assignments. Also, they suggest enhancing the final answer to include reverse proxy settings, security considerations, and component-specific network configurations.\\n\\nSo, I need to add new steps after step 2.

This error occurs when the TiClient, which acts as a client-side component in the TiDB ecosystem, attempts to interact with a region using outdated metadata. Here\\'s a detailed explanation of how this error arises and the distinction between the client (TiClient) context and server operations:\\n\\n### Context of the Error\\n\\n1. **TiClient Role**: \\n   - TiClient is responsible for communicating with the TiKV server to perform data operations. It maintains a cache of region metadata, which includes information about the region\\'s leader, its replicas, and the current epoch (a version number indicating the state of the region).\\n\\n2. **Region Operations**:\\n   - In TiDB, data is divided into regions, which are distributed across multiple TiKV nodes. Regions can undergo various operations such as splits, merges, or leader changes to optimize performance and balance load.\\n\\n### How the Error Occurs\\n\\n- **Outdated Metadata**: \\n  - The \"epoch not match\" error occurs when the TiClient\\'s cached metadata about a region becomes outdated. This can happen due to:\\n    - **Region Splits**: When a region is split into two or more regions, the epoch changes to reflect the new state.\\n    - **Region Merges**: When two regions are merged, the epoch is updated to indicate the merged state.\\n    - **Leader Changes**: If the leader of a region changes, the epoch is updated to reflect the new leadership.\\n\\n- **Mismatch Detection**:\\n  - When TiClient sends a request to TiKV using outdated region metadata, TiKV detects the mismatch in the epoch number. TiKV then returns an \"epoch not match\" error to the TiClient, indicating that the client\\'s view of the region is no longer valid.\\n\\n### Distinction Between Client and Server\\n\\n- **Client-Side (TiClient)**:\\n  - TiClient relies on cached metadata to efficiently route requests to the correct TiKV nodes. It periodically updates this cache by communicating with the Placement Driver (PD) to fetch the latest region information.\\n\\n- **Server-Side (TiKV)**:\\n  - TiKV maintains the authoritative state of regions, including their current epoch. It ensures data consistency and availability by managing region operations and responding to client requests based on the latest metadata.\\n\\n### Handling the Error\\n\\n- **Automatic Retry**:\\n  - Upon receiving an \"epoch not match\" error, TiClient automatically retries the request. It first updates its region cache by querying the PD for the latest metadata, ensuring that subsequent requests are directed to the correct region with the current epoch.\\n\\n- **Backoff Mechanism**:\\n  - TiClient employs a backoff retry mechanism to handle transient errors gracefully, reducing the likelihood of overwhelming the server with repeated requests.\\n\\nIn summary, the \"epoch not match\" error in TiDB\\'s TiClient is a result of discrepancies between the client\\'s cached region metadata and the server\\'s current state.

This can happen due to changes in the region\\'s configuration, such as splits, merges, or leader changes, which are not yet reflected in the TiDB server\\'s cache.\\n\\n2. **Region Handling in TiDB:**\\n   - In TiDB, data is divided into regions, which are the basic units of data storage and management. Each region has a leader and multiple followers, and changes to the data are first applied to the leader and then replicated to the followers.\\n   - The TiDB server maintains a cache of region information to efficiently route requests to the correct TiKV nodes. However, this cache can become stale if the region\\'s configuration changes.\\n\\n3. **Causes of the Error:**\\n   - **Region Splits or Merges:** When a region is split into multiple regions or merged with another, the epoch (version) of the region changes. If the TiDB server attempts to access the region using outdated epoch information, it will encounter an \"epoch not match\" error.\\n   - **Leader Changes:** If the leader of a region changes, the TiDB server may still attempt to communicate with the old leader, resulting in this error.\\n   - **Follower Lag:** If a follower is lagging behind and becomes a leader, it might reject requests with \"epoch not match\" if it hasn\\'t caught up with the latest epoch.\\n\\n4. **Handling the Error:**\\n   - When the TiDB server encounters an \"epoch not match\" error, it will typically refresh its region cache by querying the Placement Driver (PD) for the latest region information. This allows the TiDB server to update its routing information and retry the request with the correct region metadata.\\n   - The error is part of TiDB\\'s internal mechanisms to ensure data consistency and availability, and it is usually resolved automatically by the system without user intervention.\\n\\nIn summary, the \"epoch not match\" error is a reflection of the dynamic nature of region management in TiDB, where regions can change due to various operations.

In TiDB, regions are the basic unit of data storage, and each region has an epoch that helps manage its versioning and consistency.\\n\\n### Explanation of the \"epoch not match\" Error:\\n\\n1. **Outdated Region Cache**: The TiClient maintains a cache of region information to efficiently route requests to the correct TiKV server. However, if the region\\'s epoch changes (due to region splits, merges, or leader changes), the cached information becomes outdated. When the TiClient attempts to access a region with an outdated epoch, it receives an \"epoch not match\" error.\\n\\n2. **Backoff/Retry Mechanism**: TiDB employs a backoff and retry mechanism to handle transient errors like \"epoch not match.\" When this error occurs, the TiClient will back off for a short period and then retry the request. This mechanism helps in situations where the region\\'s metadata is being updated, allowing time for the cache to refresh.\\n\\n3. **PD\\'s Role**: The Placement Driver (PD) plays a crucial role in managing region metadata and distributing it to TiClients. When a region\\'s epoch changes, the PD updates the metadata, and the TiClient must fetch the latest information from the PD to update its cache. The PD ensures that the TiClient has the most current view of the cluster\\'s topology.\\n\\n4. **Region is Unavailable Error**: The \"epoch not match\" error can also contribute to a \"Region is Unavailable\" error. This occurs when a region is not accessible for a period due to issues like not having a leader or the TiKV server being busy. The backoff mechanism is crucial here, as it retries the request until the region becomes available or the backoff threshold is exceeded.\\n\\n5. **Follower Apply Lag**: Another related issue is the \"Follower apply lag,\" where a follower node is lagging in applying updates. If this follower becomes the leader, it might reject requests with an \"epoch not match\" error because it is not fully synchronized with the latest epoch.\\n\\n### Technical Details Verification:\\n\\n- **Epoch Management**: The epoch is a versioning mechanism for regions, ensuring consistency and correctness in distributed transactions.\\n- **Backoff/Retry**: The default backoff threshold is 20 seconds, after which the error is reported to the client if the region remains unavailable.\\n- **PD\\'s Functionality**: The PD is responsible for maintaining the cluster\\'s metadata, including region information, and distributing it to TiClients and TiKV nodes.\\n\\nThis explanation aligns with the official documentation and provides a comprehensive understanding of the \"epoch not match\" error in TiDB\\'s TiClient, emphasizing the importance of up-to-date region metadata and the role of the PD in maintaining cluster consistency.', 'reasoning': 'Alright, so I need to update the plan based on the suggestions provided.

The current plan involves reasoning, retrieving knowledge from the knowledge graph, performing a vector search, generating an explanation using an LLM, and assigning the final answer.\\n\\nThe first suggestion is to modify the prompt in the llm_generate step to emphasize that the explanation must clearly tie the error specifically to the TiClient context. This means focusing on the client\\'s region cache being outdated rather than mixing it with server-side logic. I should update the prompt in step 3 to reflect this.\\n\\nThe second suggestion is to add an additional step to verify the explanation against the official TiDB documentation. This could be done by adding another vector_search call to fetch the latest documentation or by including a check within the llm_generate prompt. I think adding a vector_search step to fetch the official documentation would be more thorough, ensuring that the explanation aligns with TiDB\\'s mechanisms.\\n\\nThe third suggestion is to include a summary step after retrieving insights from the knowledge graph and vector search.

This error occurs when there is a mismatch between the expected epoch of a region and the actual epoch that the TiKV server reports. The epoch is a version number that helps ensure consistency and correctness in distributed systems like TiDB, where data is partitioned into regions and distributed across multiple nodes.\\n\\n### Explanation of the \"epoch not match\" Error\\n\\n1. **Region Epoch**: Each region in TiDB has an epoch, which consists of a version and a configuration number. The version changes when the data in the region changes, while the configuration number changes when the region\\'s configuration (such as its size or location) changes.\\n\\n2. **Outdated Region Cache**: TiDB clients maintain a cache of region information to efficiently route requests to the correct TiKV nodes. However, this cache can become outdated due to region splits, merges, or leader changes. When a client sends a request to a TiKV node with an outdated region cache, the node may respond with an \"epoch not match\" error, indicating that the client\\'s information is no longer valid.\\n\\n3. **Backoff/Retry Mechanism**: Upon receiving an \"epoch not match\" error, TiDB employs a backoff and retry mechanism. The client will pause for a short period before retrying the request, during which it will refresh its region cache by querying the Placement Driver (PD) for the latest metadata. This process helps ensure that the client eventually has the correct region information to successfully complete the request.\\n\\n4. **PD\\'s Role**: The PD is responsible for managing the metadata of the cluster, including region information. It keeps track of region splits, merges, and leader changes, and provides this information to clients and TiKV nodes as needed. When a client encounters an \"epoch not match\" error, it queries the PD to update its region cache with the latest information.\\n\\n### Example Scenario\\n\\nConsider a scenario where a TiDB client is executing a query that involves reading data from a specific region. Initially, the client has a cached version of the region\\'s metadata. However, during the execution of the query, the region undergoes a split due to increased data volume, resulting in a new region epoch.\\n\\n1. **Initial Request**: The client sends a request to the TiKV node responsible for the region, using its cached region information.\\n\\n2. **Epoch Not Match Error**: The TiKV node detects that the client\\'s region epoch is outdated due to the recent split and responds with an \"epoch not match\" error.\\n\\n3. **Backoff and Retry**: The client enters a backoff period, during which it queries the PD to obtain the latest region metadata. The PD provides updated information about the new regions resulting from the split.\\n\\n4. **Successful Retry**: With the updated region cache, the client retries the request, this time directing it to the correct TiKV nodes based on the new region configuration. The request is processed successfully.\\n\\n### Verification Against Official Documentation\\n\\nThe explanation and scenario provided align with the official TiDB documentation, which describes the \"epoch not match\" error as a mechanism to handle outdated region information. The documentation emphasizes the importance of the backoff and retry mechanism in ensuring that clients eventually obtain the correct metadata from the PD, allowing them to interact with the TiKV nodes accurately.\\n\\nIn real-world deployments, this error is a normal part of the system\\'s operation, especially in dynamic environments where data distribution changes frequently. The backoff and retry mechanism, combined with PD\\'s role in managing metadata, ensures that TiDB can handle these changes gracefully, maintaining consistency and availability.', 'reasoning': 'Alright, so I need to update the plan based on the user\\'s suggestions.

I can add a vector_search step with a query like \"TiDB epoch not match error GitHub issues\" and set top_k to 5 to get several examples.\\n\\n2. **Modify the official documentation search step to include recent updates or changelogs.** This ensures the answer reflects the most up-to-date behavior and recommendations.

The user has given some suggestions, and I need to incorporate those into the existing plan. Let me go through this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I look at the current plan. It has several steps: retrieving TiDB basics, using vector_search for SQL syntax differences, query execution, examples, and then generating the final answer. The suggestions mention improving the plan by using dual retrieval methods, adding more specific queries, and including a validation step.\\n\\nSo, the first thing I notice is that the current plan only uses vector_search for some steps. The suggestions say to also use retrieve_knowledge_graph for each topic. That makes sense because combining both tools can give a more comprehensive answer. For example, for SQL syntax differences, I should add a retrieve_knowledge_graph step alongside the existing vector_search.\\n\\nNext, the suggestions mention adding targeted queries for specific aspects like query optimization and indexing. That means I need to include new steps that specifically address these areas. I'll add vector_search and retrieve_knowledge_graph calls for query optimization and indexing nuances.\\n\\nThen, there's the idea of adding a validation step. This step would check the accuracy and completeness of the information gathered. I can use llm_generate for this, asking the LLM to review the aggregated data and ensure it's correct and thorough.\\n\\nI also need to make sure that all the gathered information is properly synthesized into the final answer. So, I'll adjust the final llm_generate step to include all the new variables, ensuring that each part of the transition guide is covered.\\n\\nAnother consideration is maintaining the sequence numbers correctly. Since the program counter is at step 2, I need to add new steps after that, incrementing the seq_no appropriately. I'll also make sure that each new step references the correct output variables so that the final answer is comprehensive.\\n\\nI should also check that I'm not introducing any redundancies. Each new step should add value without repeating information. For example, using both vector_search and retrieve_knowledge_graph for each topic ensures a well-rounded approach without duplication.\\n\\nFinally, I'll ensure that the final answer variable is correctly assigned and that all steps contribute directly to achieving the goal.

It separates computing from storage, which allows for horizontal scalability. This architecture is beneficial for handling large-scale data and high concurrency scenarios, making TiDB ideal for cloud-native applications. TiDB integrates with components like TiKV for storage, TiFlash for analytics, and TiCDC for data replication. This separation of concerns allows TiDB to scale both compute and storage resources independently without impacting applications.\\n\\nFor more details on TiDB's architecture, you can refer to the [TiDB Architecture documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/tidb-architecture).\\n\\n### SQL Syntax Differences\\n\\nWhile TiDB is highly compatible with MySQL, there are some differences to be aware of:\\n\\n1. **DDL Operations**: TiDB supports online DDL changes but has restrictions compared to MySQL. For instance, altering multiple schema objects in a single `ALTER TABLE` statement is limited. TiDB also does not support certain data type changes using `ALTER TABLE`.\\n\\n2. **Default Differences**: TiDB uses `utf8mb4` as the default character set and `utf8mb4_bin` as the default collation, differing from MySQL 5.7 and 8.0 defaults.\\n\\n3. **Unsupported Features**: TiDB does not support features like stored procedures, triggers, and certain MySQL-specific syntaxes like `FULLTEXT` indexes and `SPATIAL` data types.\\n\\nFor a comprehensive list of differences, visit the [MySQL Compatibility page](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/mysql-compatibility).\\n\\n### Query Execution in TiDB\\n\\nTiDB optimizes SQL execution by using a declarative approach, meaning it focuses on the desired result rather than the steps to achieve it. This is similar to how GPS navigation plans routes based on various factors. TiDB's query execution involves several phases:\\n\\n- **Parsing**: Converts SQL statements into an abstract syntax tree (AST).\\n- **Compilation**: Generates execution plans based on the AST and statistics, involving logical and physical optimizations.\\n- **Execution**: Executes the plan, interacting with TiKV for data retrieval and processing.\\n\\nFor more insights into query execution, see the [SQL Tuning Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sql-tuning-overview).\\n\\n### Practical SQL Examples\\n\\nTiDB supports standard SQL operations, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Here are some examples:\\n\\n- **Insert Data**: \\n  ```sql\\n  INSERT INTO person VALUES(1, 'tom', '20170912');\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Update Data**:\\n  ```sql\\n  UPDATE person SET birthday='20180808' WHERE id=2;\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Delete Data**:\\n  ```sql\\n  DELETE FROM person WHERE id=2;\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Select Data**:\\n  ```sql\\n  SELECT * FROM person;\\n  ```\\n\\nFor a detailed guide on using SQL in TiDB, refer to the [CRUD SQL in TiDB](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/dev-guide-tidb-crud-sql).\\n\\nBy understanding these key areas, you can effectively transition from SQL Server to TiDB, leveraging its distributed architecture and MySQL compatibility for scalable and efficient database management.\", 'reasoning': \"To create a detailed action plan for someone transitioning from SQL Server to TiDB, focusing on querying capabilities, we need to address the following key areas:\\n\\n1. **Understanding TiDB Basics**: The user needs to understand what TiDB is and how it differs from SQL Server, especially in terms of architecture and purpose.\\n\\n2. **SQL Syntax Differences**: Highlight the differences and similarities in SQL syntax between SQL Server and TiDB.

By following the best practices outlined in this guide, you can effectively harness TiDB's strengths for your data management needs.\\n\\nFor further reading and detailed documentation, please refer to the provided source links.\", 'reasoning': \"Okay, so I'm trying to help update the plan for transitioning from SQL Server to TiDB. The user has given some suggestions, and I need to incorporate those into the existing plan. Let me go through this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I look at the current plan. It has several steps: retrieving TiDB basics, using vector_search for SQL syntax differences, query execution, examples, and then generating the final answer. The suggestions mention improving the plan by using dual retrieval methods, adding more specific queries, and including a validation step.\\n\\nSo, the first thing I notice is that the current plan only uses vector_search for some steps. The suggestions say to also use retrieve_knowledge_graph for each topic. That makes sense because combining both tools can give a more comprehensive answer. For example, for SQL syntax differences, I should add a retrieve_knowledge_graph step alongside the existing vector_search.\\n\\nNext, the suggestions mention adding targeted queries for specific aspects like query optimization and indexing. That means I need to include new steps that specifically address these areas. I'll add vector_search and retrieve_knowledge_graph calls for query optimization and indexing nuances.\\n\\nThen, there's the idea of adding a validation step. This step would check the accuracy and completeness of the information gathered. I can use llm_generate for this, asking the LLM to review the aggregated data and ensure it's correct and thorough.\\n\\nI also need to make sure that all the gathered information is properly synthesized into the final answer. So, I'll adjust the final llm_generate step to include all the new variables, ensuring that each part of the transition guide is covered.\\n\\nAnother consideration is maintaining the sequence numbers correctly. Since the program counter is at step 2, I need to add new steps after that, incrementing the seq_no appropriately. I'll also make sure that each new step references the correct output variables so that the final answer is comprehensive.\\n\\nI should also check that I'm not introducing any redundancies. Each new step should add value without repeating information. For example, using both vector_search and retrieve_knowledge_graph for each topic ensures a well-rounded approach without duplication.\\n\\nFinally, I'll ensure that the final answer variable is correctly assigned and that all steps contribute directly to achieving the goal.

This guide provides a detailed overview to help you make a smooth transition.\\n\\n## Understanding TiDB's Architecture\\n\\nTiDB is an open-source distributed SQL database designed for Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) workloads. It is MySQL compatible and features horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and high availability. The TiDB cluster consists of three main components:\\n\\n1. **TiDB Server**: Acts as the SQL computing layer, responsible for parsing SQL, specifying query plans, and generating executors.\\n2. **TiKV Server**: A distributed key-value storage engine that stores the actual data.\\n3. **PD (Placement Driver) Server**: Manages the cluster, allocates timestamps, and makes decisions for data placement and load balancing.\\n\\nFor more details, see the [TiDB Architecture documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-architecture).\\n\\n## SQL Syntax Differences\\n\\nWhile TiDB is highly compatible with MySQL, there are some differences compared to SQL Server:\\n\\n- **DDL Operations**: TiDB supports online DDL changes but has restrictions, such as not supporting certain data type changes using `ALTER TABLE`. For more details, see [MySQL Compatibility](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/mysql-compatibility).\\n- **Auto-increment IDs**: In TiDB, auto-increment IDs are globally unique and incremental within a single server but not necessarily sequential across multiple servers. More information can be found [here](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/mysql-compatibility#auto-increment-id).\\n- **Unsupported Features**: TiDB does not support some MySQL features like stored procedures, triggers, and user-defined functions. See the full list of unsupported features [here](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/mysql-compatibility#unsupported-features).\\n\\n## Query Execution in TiDB\\n\\nTiDB optimizes SQL execution by transforming SQL statements into key-value operations that are processed by TiKV. The SQL layer in TiDB translates SQL queries into distributed operations, allowing for efficient data retrieval and processing. For a detailed explanation of the SQL execution process, refer to the [SQL Tuning Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sql-tuning-overview).\\n\\n## Indexing in TiDB\\n\\nTiDB supports secondary indexes, which are global and can optimize query performance. However, adding too many indexes can slow down write operations and consume more storage. It's crucial to create indexes based on query patterns and data characteristics. For best practices on using indexes in TiDB, see [TiDB Best Practices](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-best-practices).\\n\\n## Query Optimization Techniques\\n\\nTo optimize SQL performance in TiDB, consider the following strategies:\\n\\n- **Use the Right Index**: Ensure that queries have appropriate indexes to avoid full table scans.\\n- **Optimize Join Types**: Choose the right join type based on the size of the tables involved.\\n- **Leverage TiFlash**: For hybrid OLTP and OLAP workloads, use the TiFlash engine for better performance.\\n\\nFor more optimization techniques, refer to the [SQL Optimization Process](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sql-optimization-concepts).\\n\\n## DDL Operations\\n\\nTiDB supports online DDL operations, allowing schema changes without downtime. However, there are some limitations compared to SQL Server, such as restrictions on altering multiple schema objects in a single statement. For a comprehensive understanding of DDL operations in TiDB, see [Execution Principles and Best Practices of DDL Statements](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/ddl-introduction).\\n\\n## Practical Examples\\n\\nHere are some basic SQL operations in TiDB:\\n\\n- **Create a Table**:\\n  ```sql\\n  CREATE TABLE person (\\n      id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\\n      name VARCHAR(255),\\n      birthday DATE\\n  );\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Insert Data**:\\n  ```sql\\n  INSERT INTO person (name, birthday) VALUES ('Alice', '1990-01-01');\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Query Data**:\\n  ```sql\\n  SELECT * FROM person WHERE name = 'Alice';\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Create an Index**:\\n  ```sql\\n  CREATE INDEX idx_name ON person (name);\\n  ```\\n\\nFor more examples and detailed SQL operations, visit [CRUD SQL in TiDB](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/dev-guide-tidb-crud-sql).\\n\\nBy understanding these key aspects, you can effectively transition from SQL Server to TiDB, leveraging its distributed architecture and compatibility with MySQL to handle large-scale data with high availability and strong consistency.\", 'reasoning': \"Alright, I need to update the plan based on the user's suggestions.

It is particularly useful for identifying discrepancies and maintaining data integrity after data migration or replication processes. This tool can compare data between MySQL and TiDB, between two MySQL databases, or between two TiDB databases. Additionally, it can generate SQL statements to repair any detected inconsistencies.\\n\\n### Key Features and Usage\\n\\n1. **Data Comparison and Repair**: \\n   - The tool compares both the table schema and the data itself. If inconsistencies are found, it generates SQL statements to help repair the data. However, these SQL statements should be reviewed before execution to ensure they are appropriate for the specific context ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sync-diff-inspector-overview)).\\n\\n2. **Configuration Options**:\\n   - **Data Chunking**: sync-diff-inspector divides data into chunks using TiDB statistics to optimize the comparison process. It is important to ensure the accuracy of these statistics by running the `analyze table {table_name}` command when the server workload is light ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sync-diff-inspector-overview)).\\n   - **Collation Configuration**: When comparing data between MySQL and TiDB, special attention should be paid to the collation settings, especially if the primary or unique keys are of the `varchar` type. Differences in collation settings can lead to incorrect comparison results, and adjustments may be needed in the configuration file ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sync-diff-inspector-overview)).\\n   - **Sharding Support**: The tool supports data checks in sharding scenarios, which is useful when data is replicated from multiple MySQL instances into TiDB. It allows for configuration of table mappings between upstream and downstream databases ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/shard-diff)).\\n\\n3. **Integration with TiDB Data Migration (DM)**:\\n   - sync-diff-inspector is often used in conjunction with TiDB Data Migration to verify data consistency after migration. It supports scenarios where data is replicated from multiple sources into a single TiDB instance, ensuring that the data remains consistent across all instances ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/shard-diff)).\\n\\n4. **Upstream-Downstream Checking**:\\n   - The tool can be configured to check data consistency between upstream and downstream TiDB clusters. This involves using TiDB Binlog to obtain a `ts-map`, which helps in setting the correct snapshot information for both the upstream and downstream databases. This ensures that the data being compared is from the same point in time ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.1/upstream-downstream-diff)).\\n\\n5. **Error Handling and Restrictions**:\\n   - sync-diff-inspector does not support online checks for data migration between MySQL and TiDB. It is crucial to ensure that no data is being written to the databases during the check. Additionally, floating-point types like `FLOAT` and `DOUBLE` are handled differently in TiDB and MySQL, which can affect checksum calculations. These columns can be ignored in the checks if necessary ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sync-diff-inspector-overview)).\\n\\nOverall, sync-diff-inspector is a powerful tool for maintaining data consistency in complex database environments, especially when dealing with migrations and sharding scenarios. It is included in the TiDB Toolkit, making it readily accessible for users of the TiDB ecosystem.', 'reasoning': \"Alright, I need to help the user update their plan based on the suggestions provided. Let me first understand the current plan and the suggestions.\\n\\nThe current plan has four steps.

Finally, it uses llm_generate to create the final answer. The program counter is at step 3, meaning the last executed step was the vector_search.\\n\\nThe suggestion is to add an extra summarization and validation step to cross-check the retrieved details. This would include specific configuration options, error handling, and integration with other TiDB components like Data Migration and upstream-downstream checking. Additionally, modifying the llm_generate step to address subtle points from configuration examples and performance considerations would improve the final answer.\\n\\nI need to incorporate these suggestions without altering the steps before the current program counter. So, I'll start from step 3 and add new steps.\\n\\nFirst, I'll keep the existing step 3, which uses llm_generate to create the initial answer.

Limitations\\n\\n- **Resource Consumption**: The tool consumes a significant amount of server resources, so it is recommended to avoid running it during peak business hours.\\n- **Collation Issues**: Differences in collation settings between MySQL and TiDB can lead to incorrect results, especially if the primary or unique keys are of the `varchar` type.\\n- **Floating-Point Precision**: There are differences in how `FLOAT` and `DOUBLE` types are handled between TiDB and MySQL, which can affect checksum calculations.\\n- **Online Checks**: The tool does not support online checks for data migration between MySQL and TiDB. It requires that no data changes occur in the specified range during the check.\\n\\n### 5. Practical Considerations\\n\\n- **Statistics Accuracy**: The tool relies on TiDB statistics for chunking data, so it is important to ensure the accuracy of these statistics. Running the `analyze table` command during low workload periods can help maintain accuracy.\\n- **SQL Confirmation**: The SQL files generated for repairing data inconsistencies should be reviewed and confirmed before execution to ensure they do not introduce errors.\\n- **Configuration Attention**: Special attention should be paid to `table-rules` and other configuration settings to ensure accurate comparisons, especially in sharding scenarios.\\n\\nFor further details and practical examples, you can visit the [sync-diff-inspector User Guide](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sync-diff-inspector-overview) and the [Data Check in the Sharding Scenario](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/shard-diff).', 'reasoning': 'Okay, so I need to update the plan based on the suggestions provided. Let me first understand what the current plan is doing and where it can be improved.\\n\\nThe goal is to explain the \"sync-diff-inspector\" tool in TiDB. The current plan has four steps: reasoning, retrieving knowledge graph data, vector search, and generating the final answer. The suggestions mention adding steps to retrieve more context from official documentation, structuring the response, and validating the final answer.\\n\\nFirst, I should consider how to incorporate the official documentation. The suggestion says to add a step using vector_search with a more specific query. That makes sense because it can fetch relevant examples and use cases. So I\\'ll add a new calling step after the existing vector_search, using a query like \"official documentation for sync-diff-inspector\".\\n\\nNext, the llm_generate prompt needs to be more structured. The suggestion wants a response that outlines purpose, features, usage, limitations, and considerations. I\\'ll modify the prompt to explicitly ask for these sections, ensuring each part is addressed.\\n\\nThen, I need to add a validation step. This should check if all aspects of the goal are covered. Using another llm_generate call with a prompt that asks for a verification of the final answer against the goal makes sense. The output of this step will be a variable that confirms whether the answer is complete.\\n\\nI also need to make sure that the output variables are correctly handled. Each new step will assign outputs to new variables, like \"official_docs\" and \"verification\". The final_answer should be generated after all these steps, ensuring it\\'s comprehensive.\\n\\nI should ensure that the sequence numbers are correct and that dependencies are properly handled. Each new step must come after the previous one to maintain the order of execution.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll structure the new plan, making sure to include all the changes without altering the initial steps up to seq_no 2. The updated plan will have additional steps for fetching official docs, enhancing the llm_generate prompt, and adding a verification step.\\n\\nI think that covers all the suggestions.

**修改现有的llm_generate步骤**：要求从检索结果中提取定量信息，例如在不同配置下的典型导出速度范围。这包括并发线程数、压缩选项和数据一致性策略等因素的影响。\\n\\n3. **强调环境影响和配置区别**：在最终答案中说明不同环境（如硬件、网络带宽、数据库负载）对导出速度的影响，并给出参考数值范围，指出这些数值仅为典型场景下的估计值。\\n\\n接下来，我需要确保这些改进能够无缝地融入现有的计划中。由于当前的程序计数器在步骤2，我需要在步骤2之后添加新的步骤，而不是修改已经执行的步骤。这包括添加一个新的vector_search步骤来检索具体的基准数据，以及修改llm_generate步骤以处理这些新数据。\\n\\n最后，我需要确保所有步骤都符合VM的规范，特别是变量引用和输出变量的正确使用。同时，避免冗余，并确保最终答案直接回应用户对量化指标的需求。\\n\\n现在，我会按照上述分析，更新计划，添加新的步骤，并调整llm_generate的提示，以确保最终答案包含定量数据和详细的分析。',

**线程数（Threads）**：Dumpling使用多线程来提高导出速度。增加线程数可以提高并发性和导出速度，但同时也会增加数据库的内存消耗。因此，设置线程数时需要权衡速度和资源使用之间的关系。通常建议线程数不超过64，以避免过高的内存消耗。\\n\\n2. **数据分块（Chunking）**：通过设置`-r`参数，Dumpling可以将数据分块导出，这有助于减少单个查询的内存使用，并提高导出效率。对于TiDB数据库，`-r`值大于0时，Dumpling会利用TiDB的region信息进行数据分割，从而优化内存使用。\\n\\n3. **压缩选项（Compression Options）**：使用`--compress`选项可以对导出的CSV和SQL文件进行压缩，支持的压缩算法包括gzip、snappy和zstd。压缩可以节省存储空间，但会增加CPU使用，并可能降低导出速度。因此，在对速度要求较高的场景中需谨慎使用。\\n\\n4. **数据一致性（Data Consistency）**：Dumpling提供多种数据一致性选项，如`flush`、`snapshot`、`lock`等。选择不同的一致性选项会影响导出过程的复杂性和速度。例如，使用`flush`选项会暂时中断数据库的DML和DDL操作，以确保备份的一致性。\\n\\n5. **内存使用（Memory Usage）**：导出大表时，可能会因为数据量过大而导致内存不足（OOM）。可以通过调整`--tidb-mem-quota-query`参数来限制单个查询的内存使用，或者通过`--params`参数调整TiDB的扫描并发性。\\n\\n通过合理配置这些参数，Dumpling可以在导出数据时实现较高的速度和效率。具体的配置和性能优化可以参考以下文档：[Dumpling

This compatibility is primarily due to TiDB's support for the MySQL 5.7 protocol and its common features and syntax. As a result, many ecosystem tools that are commonly used with MySQL, such as PHPMyAdmin, Navicat, MySQL Workbench, mysqldump, and Mydumper/myloader, can also be utilized with TiDB. This means that developers and database administrators can continue using their familiar tools and workflows without needing to learn new systems or processes, thereby reducing the learning curve and potential disruptions during migration.\\n\\nMoreover, TiDB provides specific tools to facilitate data replication between MySQL and TiDB, even though it does not support the MySQL replication protocol directly. For instance, TiDB Data Migration (DM) supports full data migration and incremental data replication from MySQL or MariaDB into TiDB. Similarly, TiCDC is a tool for replicating the incremental data of TiDB to MySQL by pulling TiKV change logs. These tools ensure that data can be seamlessly transferred between the two systems, maintaining data consistency and integrity during the migration process.\\n\\nHowever, it is important to note that some MySQL features are not supported in TiDB. These include stored procedures, triggers, events, user-defined functions, and certain syntax and indexes like `FULLTEXT` and `SPATIAL`. Additionally, some features might be challenging to implement in a distributed system like TiDB.

Here\\'s a detailed guide to help you troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\\n\\n### Step 1: Check TiDB System Tables\\n\\n1. **Inspect `stats_meta` Table:**\\n   - Use the following SQL command to check the `stats_meta` table, which contains metadata about the statistics:\\n     ```sql\\n     SHOW STATS_META;\\n     ```\\n   - Look for any anomalies or inconsistencies in the data, such as unexpected row counts or update times.\\n\\n2. **Inspect `stats_histograms` Table:**\\n   - Use the following SQL command to check the `stats_histograms` table, which contains histogram data:\\n     ```sql\\n     SHOW STATS_HISTOGRAMS;\\n     ```\\n   - Verify that the histograms are populated correctly and that there are no missing or empty entries.\\n\\n### Step 2: Verify `tidb_analyze_version` Parameter\\n\\n- The `tidb_analyze_version` parameter determines the version of the statistics collection method used by TiDB. Ensure that this parameter is set correctly:\\n  ```sql\\n  SHOW VARIABLES LIKE \\'tidb_analyze_version\\';\\n  ```\\n- If necessary, adjust the parameter to a compatible version. For example, if you are using TiDB version 4.0 or later, you might want to use version 2 of the statistics:\\n  ```sql\\n  SET GLOBAL tidb_analyze_version = 2;\\n  ```\\n\\n### Step 3: Inspect TiDB Logs\\n\\n- Check the TiDB server logs for any error messages or warnings related to statistics. The logs can provide insights into what might be causing the issue.\\n- Look for entries related to statistics collection, histogram updates, or any specific error messages that mention \"fail to get stats version.\"\\n\\n### Step 4: Analyze Error Stack Traces\\n\\n- If the error is accompanied by a stack trace, analyze it to identify the source of the problem. The stack trace can point to specific functions or modules where the error occurred.\\n- Use the stack trace to correlate with known issues or bugs in the TiDB version you are using.\\n\\n### Step 5: Consider Known Issues and Fixes\\n\\n- Review the release notes and documentation for your version of TiDB to identify any known issues related to statistics. For example, TiDB 7.6.0 and 2.0.9 have addressed specific bugs related to histogram statistics and empty statistics histograms.\\n- If a known issue matches your problem, consider upgrading to a version where the issue is resolved.\\n\\n### Additional Considerations\\n\\n- **Empty Statistics Histogram Issue:** If you encounter empty histograms, it might be due to a bug that was fixed in TiDB 2.0.9. Consider upgrading if you are on an older version.\\n- **Histogram Statistics Parsing Issue:** If histograms contain `NULL` values, ensure you are using a version that has fixed this parsing issue, such as TiDB 7.6.0.\\n- **Global Statistics Merging Error:** If you are dealing with partitioned tables, ensure that you are using a version that has addressed the merging error, such as TiDB 7.5.1.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the \"fail to get stats version\" error in TiDB.

This compatibility ensures that many MySQL features and behaviors are supported in TiDB, allowing for a smoother transition with minimal changes to application code.\\n\\n### Protocol Compatibility\\nTiDB is highly compatible with the MySQL protocol, which means that applications using MySQL can communicate with TiDB using the same protocol without requiring modifications. This compatibility extends to the MySQL server protocol, which facilitates the return of errors and warnings to client applications, allowing them to handle these appropriately as they would with a MySQL server.\\n\\n### SQL Syntax Alignment\\nTiDB supports most MySQL syntax and features, which means that SQL queries written for MySQL can often be executed in TiDB without modification. This alignment reduces the need for extensive rewriting of SQL queries during migration.\\n\\n### Authentication Methods\\nWhile TiDB supports many of the authentication methods used by MySQL, there are some differences, particularly with methods specific to MariaDB. Before migrating, it is important to verify the authentication methods used in your MySQL setup and ensure they are supported by TiDB. If certain methods are not supported, you may need to create new password hashes or take other measures. For more details, you can refer to the [Security Compatibility with MySQL](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/security-compatibility-with-mysql) document.\\n\\n### Data Type Discrepancies\\nThere are some data types supported by MySQL that TiDB does not support, such as `UUID`, `INET4`, and `INET6`. It is crucial to identify these data types in your MySQL database and plan for their conversion or replacement in TiDB. You can check for these data types using SQL queries on your MySQL database. More information on this can be found in the [Migrate Data from MariaDB to TiDB](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/migrate-from-mariadb) guide.\\n\\n### Configuration Concerns\\nTiDB has some default configuration differences compared to MySQL. For instance, TiDB uses `utf8mb4` as the default character set, whereas MySQL 5.7 defaults to `latin1`. Additionally, TiDB's default collation is `utf8mb4_bin`, which differs from MySQL's defaults. These differences can affect how data is stored and compared, so it's important to review and adjust configurations as needed during migration. For a detailed comparison, see the [MySQL Compatibility](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/mysql-compatibility) document.\\n\\n### Other Migration Considerations\\n- **System-Versioned Tables**: TiDB does not support system-versioned tables, a feature available in MariaDB. However, TiDB supports the `AS OF TIMESTAMP` feature, which can replace some use cases of system-versioned tables.\\n- **Storage Engines**: While TiDB can migrate data from various MySQL storage engines, it does not support storing data outside of the TiDB cluster, as some MySQL engines do.\\n- **Incremental Replication**: TiDB Data Migration (DM) can be used to replicate binlogs from MySQL to TiDB, which helps in reducing downtime during migration.\\n\\nBy understanding these compatibility aspects and planning accordingly, the migration from MySQL to TiDB can be executed more smoothly, leveraging TiDB's compatibility with the MySQL protocol and its features. For more detailed guidance on migration strategies, you can explore the [Data Migration Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/migration-overview) and [TiDB Data Migration Best Practices](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/dm-best-practices).\", 'reasoning': \"Okay, I need to update the plan based on the suggestions provided.

This compatibility ensures that many MySQL features and behaviors are supported in TiDB, allowing for a smoother transition with minimal changes to application code.\\n\\n### Protocol Compatibility\\nTiDB is highly compatible with the MySQL protocol, which means that applications using MySQL can often connect to TiDB without needing to modify their connection logic. This compatibility extends to the MySQL server protocol, facilitating seamless communication between client applications and the TiDB server. This is particularly beneficial for applications that rely on MySQL's client-server interactions, as they can continue to operate as expected when migrated to TiDB.\\n\\n### SQL Syntax Alignment\\nTiDB supports most of the MySQL syntax and features, which means that SQL queries written for MySQL are likely to work in TiDB without modification. This alignment reduces the need for extensive rewriting of SQL queries during migration, making the process more efficient and less error-prone.\\n\\n### Authentication Methods\\nWhile TiDB supports many of the authentication methods used in MySQL, there are some differences, particularly with methods specific to MariaDB. Before migrating, it's important to verify the authentication methods used in your MySQL setup and ensure they are supported by TiDB. If certain methods are not supported, you may need to create new password hashes or take other measures to ensure secure access. For more details, you can refer to the [Security Compatibility with MySQL](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/migrate-from-mariadb).\\n\\n### Data Type Discrepancies\\nAlthough TiDB supports most MySQL data types, there are some exceptions. For instance, certain data types like `UUID`, `INET4`, and `INET6` in MariaDB are not supported in TiDB. It's crucial to review the data types used in your MySQL database and make necessary adjustments to ensure compatibility. You can check for these data types using SQL queries to identify any potential issues before migration. More information can be found in the [MariaDB to TiDB migration guide](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/migrate-from-mariadb).\\n\\n### Configuration Concerns\\nThere are some default configuration differences between TiDB and MySQL that need to be considered.

These differences can affect how data is stored and retrieved, so it's important to review and adjust configurations as needed during migration. For a detailed comparison, see the [MySQL Compatibility](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/mysql-compatibility) documentation.\\n\\n### Other Migration Considerations\\nWhen migrating from MySQL to TiDB, it's also important to consider the overall data migration strategy, including full data migration and incremental replication. Tools like TiDB Lightning and TiDB Data Migration (DM) can facilitate these processes, ensuring that both existing data and ongoing changes are accurately migrated to TiDB. For a comprehensive overview of data migration solutions, refer to the [Data Migration Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/migration-overview).\\n\\nBy addressing these compatibility and configuration considerations, the migration from MySQL to TiDB can be executed more smoothly, minimizing disruptions and ensuring that applications continue to function as expected in the new environment.\", 'reasoning': \"Alright, so I need to update the plan based on the user's suggestions to make the explanation more comprehensive.

This means that applications using MySQL can often connect to TiDB using the same drivers and tools they are already using, without needing to modify the application code extensively.\\n\\n### Migration Challenges\\n\\nDespite the high level of compatibility, there are some challenges and considerations to keep in mind during migration:\\n\\n1. **Data Type Compatibility**: While TiDB supports many of the same data types as MySQL, there are some differences. For instance, MariaDB, a MySQL-compatible database, supports data types like `UUID`, `INET4`, and `INET6`, which TiDB does not support. It's important to check for these data types in your existing database and plan for how to handle them in TiDB. You can use SQL queries to identify these data types in your current database schema ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/migrate-from-mariadb)).\\n\\n2. **Configuration Differences**: TiDB does not support certain MySQL-specific features, such as system-versioned tables and some storage engines like `CONNECT` and `Spider`. These features need to be addressed before migration. For example, system-versioned tables in MariaDB can be replaced with TiDB's `AS OF TIMESTAMP` feature for some use cases ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/migrate-from-mariadb)).\\n\\n3. **Authentication Methods**: TiDB supports a subset of MySQL's authentication methods. If your MySQL or MariaDB setup uses unsupported authentication methods, you may need to create new password hashes or take other measures to ensure compatibility ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/migrate-from-mariadb)).\\n\\n### Migration Strategies\\n\\nFor migrating data from MySQL-compatible databases to TiDB, several strategies can be employed:\\n\\n- **Full Data Migration**: Tools like TiDB Lightning can be used to import data from Amazon Aurora snapshots, CSV files, or SQL dump files into TiDB. This is suitable for scenarios where you can afford some downtime during the migration process ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/migration-overview)).\\n\\n- **Incremental Replication**: TiDB Data Migration (DM) can be used to replicate binlogs from MySQL, MariaDB, or Aurora to TiDB. This approach minimizes downtime by allowing ongoing data changes to be replicated to TiDB during the migration process ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/migration-overview)).\\n\\n- **Network and Privilege Configuration**: Before starting the migration, ensure that the necessary network connections and database privileges are configured. This includes setting up VPC peering if needed and granting the appropriate privileges to the user accounts used for migration ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/migrate-from-mysql-using-data-migration)).\\n\\nBy understanding these challenges and preparing accordingly, the migration from MySQL to TiDB can be a smooth process, leveraging TiDB's compatibility with the MySQL protocol to minimize disruptions and maintain application functionality.\", 'reasoning': \"Okay, so I need to figure out how to update the plan based on the user's suggestions.

This compatibility ensures that most MySQL applications can interact with TiDB without requiring significant changes to the application code. Here are some key aspects of how this compatibility facilitates migration, along with potential challenges and considerations:\\n\\n### Migration Benefits\\n\\n1. **Protocol Compatibility**: TiDB's high compatibility with the MySQL protocol means that applications using MySQL can connect to TiDB using the same MySQL client libraries and tools. This reduces the need for rewriting application logic or changing database connection methods.\\n\\n2. **SQL Syntax and Features**: TiDB supports most MySQL syntax and features, which allows for a smoother transition of SQL queries and operations from MySQL to TiDB. This includes support for common SQL operations and transaction handling, which are crucial for maintaining application functionality during migration.\\n\\n### Migration Challenges\\n\\n1. **Data Type Compatibility**: While TiDB supports many MySQL data types, there are some differences. For instance, MariaDB supports data types like `UUID`, `INET4`, and `INET6`, which are not supported by TiDB. Identifying and addressing these differences is crucial to ensure data integrity and application performance post-migration. You can check for these data types using SQL queries to identify potential issues before migration ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/migrate-from-mariadb)).\\n\\n2. **Configuration Differences**: There might be configuration settings in MySQL or MariaDB that do not have direct equivalents in TiDB.

This error suggests that TiCDC is attempting to access a column that does not exist in the current schema, which can occur due to several reasons:\\n\\n1. **Schema Changes Not Captured**: One common cause is that a Data Definition Language (DDL) event, such as an `ALTER TABLE` statement that adds or renames columns, was not captured or applied correctly. This can lead to discrepancies between the expected schema in TiCDC and the actual schema in the database.\\n\\n2. **Column Mapping Issues**: The prefix `_Col$_` indicates that the column might be internally generated or transformed by TiCDC during its operations. If there are transformations or mappings applied to column names, these need to be consistent across all operations and configurations.\\n\\n3. **Configuration Errors**: Misconfigurations in TiCDC settings, such as incorrect filter rules or sync configurations, can lead to such errors. It\\'s crucial to ensure that all configurations are correctly set to capture and apply all necessary schema changes.\\n\\n### Solution and Recommendations\\n\\n1. **Verify DDL Event Capture**: Ensure that all DDL events are being captured and applied correctly. You can check the TiCDC logs for any missed DDL events or errors during DDL processing. If you find any discrepancies, you may need to manually apply the missing DDL changes to the downstream systems.\\n\\n2. **Check Column Mappings**: Review the column mappings and transformations in your TiCDC configuration. Ensure that any transformations applied to column names are consistent and correctly configured. Pay special attention to any rules that might affect columns with prefixes like `_Col$_`.\\n\\n3. **Review Configuration Settings**: Double-check your TiCDC configuration settings, especially those related to filtering and schema management. Ensure that the `rules` for database and table filtering are correctly set up to include all necessary columns and tables.\\n\\n4. **Test with a Sample Dataset**: If possible, replicate the issue in a test environment with a sample dataset.

Here\\'s a detailed explanation and solution:\\n\\n### Potential Causes:\\n\\n1. **Missed DDL Events**:\\n   - TiCDC relies on capturing and replicating DDL events to ensure that the schema changes in the upstream database are reflected in the downstream systems. If a DDL event, such as adding a new column, is missed or not replicated, it can lead to errors like the one encountered. This might happen if the DDL statement was not included in the allow list or if there was a failure in the replication process.\\n\\n2. **Privilege Misconfigurations**:\\n   - TiCDC requires certain privileges to capture and replicate changes effectively. If the TiCDC user does not have the necessary permissions to access or replicate certain schema changes, it might result in errors. Ensuring that the TiCDC user has adequate privileges to perform all necessary operations is crucial.\\n\\n3. **Version-Related Issues**:\\n   - Different versions of TiCDC and TiDB might have varying levels of support for certain features or bug fixes. Using an outdated version might lead to compatibility issues or bugs that have been resolved in later versions.\\n\\n### Solutions:\\n\\n1. **Verify DDL Replication**:\\n   - Ensure that all necessary DDL statements are included in the TiCDC allow list for replication. You can refer to the [Changefeed DDL Replication documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/ticdc-ddl) to verify which DDL statements are supported and ensure they are correctly configured.\\n\\n2. **Check User Privileges**:\\n   - Verify that the TiCDC user has the required privileges to access and replicate all necessary database objects. This includes permissions to read from the source database and write to the downstream systems.\\n\\n3. **Upgrade to a Recommended Version**:\\n   - Consider upgrading to a more recent version of TiCDC and TiDB that might have addressed this issue. For example, starting from TiDB v7.1.0, TiCDC has improved handling of redundant DML events, which might help in avoiding similar issues. You can check the [TiCDC FAQs](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/ticdc-faq) for more information on version-specific improvements and recommendations.\\n\\nBy addressing these potential causes, you can mitigate the risk of encountering the \"Unknown column\" error and ensure smoother operation of TiCDC in your environment.', 'reasoning': \"Okay, so I'm trying to help update the plan for resolving the TiCDC error.

This makes sense because the current query is too broad, and a more specific search would yield better results.\\n\\nNext, the suggestion mentions modifying the llm_generate step to reference both the knowledge graph and the refined vector search results. This is important because it ensures that all gathered information is synthesized effectively. Also, it's recommended to check for issues like missed DDL events, privilege misconfigurations, and version upgrades. That's a good point because these are common causes for such errors.\\n\\nAnother suggestion is to add an extra step for cross-validating the final answer with targeted documentation or release notes.

Verify Privilege Configurations\\n- **Issue**: Insufficient privileges might prevent TiCDC from capturing or applying DDL changes.\\n- **Solution**: Ensure that the user account used by TiCDC has the necessary privileges to read binlogs and apply DDL changes. This includes privileges like `SELECT`, `REPLICATION SLAVE`, and `REPLICATION CLIENT` on the source database.\\n\\n### 3. Check Schema Mapping and Consistency\\n- **Issue**: Schema mapping mismatches between the source and target databases can lead to unknown column errors.\\n- **Solution**: Verify that the schema in the downstream database matches the expected schema from the upstream database. Use the `binlog-schema` command in TiDB Data Migration (DM) to manage and verify schema consistency. For more information, see the [Manage Table Schemas documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/dm-manage-schema).\\n\\n### 4.

Here is a detailed action plan:\\n\\n### Scenarios for Disabling Automatic Compactions\\n\\nDisabling automatic compactions in TiKV can be beneficial in specific scenarios, such as during data import operations where write performance is critical. For instance, when using TiDB Lightning to import large datasets, disabling automatic compactions can prevent unnecessary I/O operations that might slow down the import process. This approach allows for more controlled and efficient data handling during peak write operations.\\n\\n### Strategies for Manual Compactions\\n\\n1. **Manual Compaction Commands**: Use the `tikv-ctl` tool to manually trigger compactions. This can be done for individual TiKV nodes or the entire cluster. For example, to compact data in the local mode, use:\\n   ```bash\\n   tikv-ctl --data-dir /path/to/tikv compact -d kv\\n   ```\\n   For remote mode:\\n   ```bash\\n   tikv-ctl --host ip:port compact -d kv\\n   ```\\n   [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tikv-control)\\n\\n2. **Compaction Range and Concurrency**: Specify the compaction range using `--from` and `--to` options, and adjust concurrency with the `--threads` option to balance compaction speed and service impact. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tikv-control)\\n\\n3. **Periodic Full Compaction**: Although experimental, periodic full compaction can be scheduled during off-peak hours to improve performance during peak periods. Configure this using `periodic-full-compact-start-times` in the TiKV configuration. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tikv-configuration-file)\\n\\n### Monitoring Tools and Best Practices\\n\\n1. **Grafana and Prometheus**: Utilize Grafana dashboards to monitor TiKV performance metrics. The TiKV-FastTune dashboard is particularly useful for diagnosing write-related performance issues. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/grafana-tikv-dashboard)\\n\\n2. **Performance Overview Dashboard**: Analyze key metrics and resource utilization to identify bottlenecks and determine if scaling is necessary. This dashboard provides insights into read and write traffic patterns, helping to optimize compaction strategies. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/performance-tuning-methods)\\n\\n3. **Alert Systems**: Set up alerts for I/O-related issues such as write stalls, which can indicate the need for manual compaction or configuration adjustments. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/troubleshoot-high-disk-io)\\n\\n### Interaction with Other Configurations\\n\\n1. **GC and Compaction Filter**: Enable GC in Compaction Filter to integrate garbage collection with the compaction process, reducing extra disk reads and improving performance. This can be configured in the TiKV settings. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/garbage-collection-configuration)\\n\\n2. **Titan Engine**: Consider enabling the Titan engine for key-value separation to reduce write amplification and improve compaction efficiency, especially for large values. Adjust `min-blob-size` and `blob-file-compression` settings to optimize performance. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/titan-configuration)\\n\\n### Examples of Successful Management\\n\\n1. **Public Cloud Deployments**: In cloud environments, enabling Titan and adjusting compression levels can significantly reduce compaction I/O flow, improving performance under limited disk throughput conditions. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/best-practices-on-public-cloud)\\n\\n2. **Performance Tuning**: Adjusting compaction modes based on system resources can optimize TiKV performance.

Here’s a detailed action plan:\\n\\n### 1. Scenarios for Disabling Automatic Compactions\\n\\nDisabling automatic compactions can be beneficial in specific scenarios to optimize performance and resource utilization:\\n\\n- **Write-Heavy Workloads**: In environments with high write throughput, disabling automatic compactions can temporarily improve write performance by reducing the immediate overhead of compaction processes.\\n- **Scheduled Maintenance**: During scheduled maintenance windows or off-peak hours, disabling automatic compactions allows for manual control over when compactions occur, minimizing impact on performance during peak times.\\n\\n### 2. Strategies for Manual Compactions\\n\\nImplementing manual compactions can help manage storage efficiency and performance:\\n\\n- **Use of TiKV Control Tool**: Utilize the `tikv-ctl` tool to manually compact data. This tool allows specifying compaction ranges, column families, and concurrency levels to tailor the compaction process to your needs. For more details, see the [TiKV Control User Guide](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tikv-control).\\n\\n- **Enable Titan for Large Values**: For workloads with large values, enabling Titan can reduce write amplification and improve performance. Configure Titan with appropriate settings such as `min-blob-size` and `blob-file-compression` to optimize compaction I/O flow. More information is available in the [TiDB Best Practices on Public Cloud](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/best-practices-on-public-cloud).\\n\\n### 3. Monitoring Tools and Best Practices\\n\\nEffective monitoring is crucial for managing TiKV storage:\\n\\n- **Grafana Dashboards**: Utilize the TiKV-Details and TiKV-FastTune dashboards in Grafana to monitor performance metrics and diagnose issues. These dashboards provide insights into CPU utilization, I/O flow, and compaction activities. For more information, refer to the [Grafana TiKV Dashboard](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/grafana-tikv-dashboard).\\n\\n- **Prometheus and Grafana**: Leverage Prometheus for metric collection and Grafana for visualization to analyze the status of the TiDB cluster. This combination helps in identifying resource bottlenecks and optimizing performance. See [Grafana Monitor Best Practices](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/grafana-monitor-best-practices) for further guidance.\\n\\n### 4. Interaction with Other Configurations\\n\\nUnderstanding how compaction settings interact with other configurations is vital:\\n\\n- **Garbage Collection (GC) Policies**: Compaction processes are integral to GC efficiency. Disabling auto-compactions may reduce the effectiveness of GC, leading to increased storage usage. For GC configuration details, visit [Garbage Collection Configuration](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/garbage-collection-configuration).\\n\\n- **Titan Engine**: The Titan engine optimizes storage for large values. Disabling auto-compactions can affect Titan's ability to manage blob files efficiently. Review the [Titan Configuration](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/titan-configuration) for detailed settings.\\n\\n### 5. Examples of Successful Management\\n\\nOrganizations have successfully implemented manual compactions to enhance performance:\\n\\n- **Public Cloud Deployments**: By enabling Titan and adjusting compaction settings, organizations have reduced write amplification and improved performance on public cloud infrastructure. This strategy is detailed in the [TiDB Best Practices on Public Cloud](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/best-practices-on-public-cloud).\\n\\n- **Memory Performance Tuning**: Adjusting the compaction mode in RocksDB has helped organizations balance CPU and I/O resources, optimizing performance based on system capabilities. More information can be found in the [Tune TiKV Memory Parameter Performance](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tune-tikv-memory-performance).\\n\\nBy following this action plan, organizations can effectively manage TiKV storage, ensuring high performance and efficient resource utilization. Regular monitoring and strategic adjustments to compaction settings will help maintain a robust TiKV environment.\", 'reasoning': \"Alright, I'm trying to help update the plan based on the user's suggestions and the current execution state. Let me go through the process step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the original plan. The goal is to analyze scenarios where disabling automatic compactions in TiKV is beneficial, strategies for manual compactions, monitoring tools, configuration interactions, and real-world examples. The original plan uses a series of `calling` instructions with `retrieve_knowledge_graph` and `vector_search` followed by `llm_generate` to synthesize the information.\\n\\nThe user's suggestions include:\\n1. Using dual retrieval methods (both vector_search and knowledge graph) for each query to cross-validate data.\\n2. Adding intermediate synthesis steps after each retrieval to prioritize relevant details.\\n3. Incorporating additional steps for operational case studies and configuration interactions, especially with settings like GC policies and the Titan engine.\\n\\nI need to ensure that the updated plan aligns with these suggestions without altering the initial steps up to seq_no 1. Let me think about how to integrate these changes.\\n\\nStarting from the current program counter (seq_no 2), I should modify the subsequent steps. For each retrieval step, I'll add both `retrieve_knowledge_graph` and `vector_search` to gather comprehensive data. Then, after each pair, I'll insert an `llm_generate` step to synthesize the information into a structured format. This approach ensures cross-validated data and clearer prioritization.\\n\\nAdditionally, I need to add steps for operational case studies and detailed configuration interactions. This means introducing new queries for these specific areas and processing them similarly with dual retrieval and synthesis.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that the final synthesis step incorporates all the gathered information, including the new areas. This might involve restructuring the final `llm_generate` to handle a broader range of variables.\\n\\nPotential challenges include managing the increased number of variables and ensuring that each synthesis step correctly references the appropriate data. I must also avoid redundancy and maintain a logical flow in the plan.\\n\\nFinally, I'll structure the updated plan by sequentially adding the new steps after the initial ones, ensuring each has a unique `seq_no` and follows the correct order.

Let me go through each step carefully.\\n\\nFirst, the user suggested using both retrieve_knowledge_graph and vector_search for each query to cross-check and enrich the data. So, for each sub-goal, I should add both retrieval methods. That means for each of the five sub-goals, I'll have two retrieval steps instead of one.\\n\\nNext, the user recommended introducing intermediate synthesis steps after each retrieval. This way, I can process the data immediately, prioritize it, and integrate it before moving on. So, after each pair of retrieve and vector search, I'll add an llm_generate step to synthesize the information.\\n\\nAlso, the user mentioned adding steps to gather real-world examples and case studies. I should include vector_search calls with queries focused on finding examples and best practices from other organizations.\\n\\nI need to ensure that each synthesis step uses the outputs from the previous retrieval steps. For example, after retrieving compaction scenarios using both tools, I'll use llm_generate to create a structured analysis.\\n\\nI'll also make sure to handle variable references correctly. Each retrieval step will store its output in specific variables, which the synthesis steps will then reference.\\n\\nLooking at the original plan, I'll start by keeping the first step (seq_no 0) unchanged. Then, for each subsequent sub-goal, I'll add the necessary retrieve and vector_search steps followed by synthesis. This approach should make the plan more comprehensive and ensure that all aspects of the user's query are addressed thoroughly.\\n\\nI should also check that the final llm_generate step includes all synthesized variables to form the complete final answer. This way, the response will be well-rounded, covering all the scenarios, strategies, tools, interactions, and examples the user is interested in.\\n\\nFinally, I'll ensure that the plan remains efficient by processing each sub-goal in sequence without unnecessary jumps or complexities.

Here are some potential causes and solutions for this issue:\\n\\n### Potential Causes\\n\\n1. **Network Latency or Instability**: High network latency or instability between TiCDC and other components like TiKV or PD (Placement Driver) can prevent the resolved TS from advancing. This is because TiCDC relies on timely communication with these components to update the resolved TS.\\n\\n2. **Resource Constraints**: Insufficient CPU, memory, or disk I/O resources allocated to TiCDC can cause performance bottlenecks, leading to delays in processing DDL events and advancing the resolved TS.\\n\\n3. **Version-Specific Bugs**: Certain versions of TiCDC might have bugs that affect the advancement of the resolved TS. For example, issues related to the handling of DDL events or the internal state management of TiCDC can cause this problem.\\n\\n4. **Configuration Issues**: Incorrect configuration settings, such as those related to concurrency, memory limits, or network timeouts, can impact the performance of TiCDC and its ability to process DDL events efficiently.\\n\\n### Solutions\\n\\n1. **Network Optimization**: \\n   - Ensure that the network latency between TiCDC, TiKV, and PD is minimized. This can be achieved by optimizing network configurations, using dedicated network interfaces, or upgrading network hardware if necessary.\\n   - Check for any network issues or packet loss that might be affecting communication between components.\\n\\n2. **Resource Allocation**:\\n   - Increase the CPU and memory resources allocated to TiCDC. This can help in handling a higher volume of DDL events and improving the overall performance of the component.\\n   - Monitor disk I/O performance and ensure that the storage subsystem is not a bottleneck.\\n\\n3. **Upgrade TiCDC**:\\n   - Check the release notes for your version of TiCDC to identify any known bugs related to the resolved TS advancement. If such bugs are present, consider upgrading to a newer version where these issues have been fixed.\\n   - For example, the TiDB 5.3.2 release notes mention fixes for issues that could cause TiCDC clusters to panic after an upgrade, which might be related to resolved TS problems.\\n\\n4. **Configuration Tuning**:\\n   - Review and adjust TiCDC configuration settings, such as `max-message-size` and `max-message-batch`, to ensure they are appropriate for your workload.\\n   - Consider enabling or adjusting the `unified sorter` feature, which can help accelerate replication when the data size of the incremental scan is large.\\n\\n5. **Monitoring and Diagnostics**:\\n   - Use TiDB\\'s monitoring tools to track the performance and health of TiCDC. Look for metrics related to resolved TS, network latency, and resource usage.\\n   - If the issue persists, consider reaching out to TiDB support for further assistance, especially if you suspect a version-specific bug.\\n\\nBy addressing these potential causes and implementing the suggested solutions, you can help ensure that the resolved TS in TiCDC advances as expected, thereby maintaining the integrity and performance of your TiDB replication setup.', 'reasoning': 'Okay, so I\\'m trying to figure out how to update the plan based on the user\\'s suggestions.

This can lead to replication lag or even a halt in data synchronization processes. Here are some potential causes and solutions for this issue:\\n\\n### Potential Causes\\n\\n1. **Network Latency or Instability**: High network latency or instability between TiDB, TiKV, and PD (Placement Driver) nodes can cause delays in advancing the resolved TS. Check the network latency values using monitoring tools like Grafana. Ideally, network latency should be below 1ms for optimal performance.\\n\\n2. **Resource Constraints**: Insufficient CPU, memory, or disk I/O resources on TiCDC nodes can slow down the processing of DDL events. Monitor resource usage statistics to ensure that TiCDC nodes have adequate resources. CPU usage should ideally be below 70%, and memory usage should not exceed 80% of available memory.\\n\\n3. **Configuration Issues**: Incorrect configuration parameters in TiCDC can affect the performance of DDL processing. Ensure that parameters such as `max-message-size` and `max-message-batch` are set appropriately for your workload. Additionally, verify that the `enable-old-value` configuration is set correctly if using the Canal protocol.\\n\\n4. **Version-Specific Bugs**: Certain versions of TiCDC may have bugs that affect DDL processing. For example, issues with the `enable-old-value` configuration not being set automatically on the Canal protocol were fixed in later versions. Check the release notes for your TiDB version to identify any known bugs and their fixes.\\n\\n5. **Stuck Changefeeds**: Changefeeds might get stuck due to issues like network isolation or incorrect configuration. Ensure that changefeeds are configured correctly and that there are no network issues affecting their operation.\\n\\n### Solutions\\n\\n1. **Network Optimization**: Reduce network latency by ensuring a stable and high-speed network connection between TiDB, TiKV, and PD nodes. Consider using a dedicated network for TiDB traffic if possible.\\n\\n2. **Resource Allocation**: Allocate more resources to TiCDC nodes if they are under heavy load. This might involve increasing the number of CPU cores, adding more memory, or using faster storage solutions like SSDs.\\n\\n3. **Configuration Review**: Review and adjust TiCDC configuration parameters to better suit your workload.

官方文档中关于WITH GRANT OPTION和NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER的说明\\n\\n- **WITH GRANT OPTION**：允许用户将其拥有的权限授予其他用户。使用此选项时需谨慎，因为它可能导致权限的过度扩散。\\n  \\n- **NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER**：默认情况下启用，防止在`GRANT`语句中自动创建用户。禁用此选项可能导致安全风险，因为拼写错误的用户名会导致创建一个没有密码的新用户。\\n\\n### 3. 错误案例及修正案例\\n\\n- **错误案例**：错误1221通常发生在试图将数据库级别的权限与全局权限混合使用时。\\n  ```sql\\n  GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'username'@'host'; -- 错误：试图在全局级别授予数据库权限\\n  ```\\n\\n- **修正案例**：确保权限级别的一致性。\\n  ```sql\\n  GRANT SELECT ON db_name.* TO 'username'@'host'; -- 正确：在数据库级别授予权限\\n  ```\\n\\n### 4. 最佳实践和注意事项\\n\\n- **明确权限范围**：在授予权限时，尽量限制在必要的范围内，避免使用`GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES`，除非绝对必要。\\n  \\n- **使用`WITH GRANT OPTION`时的谨慎**：仅在信任的用户上使用此选项，以防止权限的滥用。\\n\\n- **定期审查用户权限**：使用`SHOW GRANTS FOR

'newuser';\\n     SHOW GRANTS FOR 'newuser';\\n     ```\\n   - 授予全局权限：\\n     ```sql\\n     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'adminuser' WITH GRANT OPTION;\\n     ```\\n\\n3. **避免错误1221**：\\n   - 错误1221通常发生在尝试在不兼容的权限级别上授予权限时。例如，试图在数据库级别授予全局权限。\\n   - 确保在授予权限时，权限级别与权限类型相匹配。例如，全局权限应在`*.*`级别授予，而不是在特定数据库或表级别。\\n\\n### MySQL兼容性\\n\\n- TiDB的权限系统与MySQL兼容，但有一些差异。例如，在TiDB中，`GRANT`语句的执行结果会立即在当前连接上生效，而在MySQL中，某些权限的执行结果可能仅在后续连接中生效。\\n- TiDB不支持列级别的权限。\\n\\n### 参考文档\\n\\n有关更多详细信息和最新更新，请参考以下官方TiDB文档：\\n- [GRANT <privileges> SQL Statement Reference](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/sql-statement-grant-privileges)\\n- [Privilege Management in TiDB](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/privilege-management)\\n\\n通过遵循上述指南，您可以有效地使用`GRANT`语句并避免常见错误。确保在使用时仔细检查权限级别和类型的匹配，以避免不必要的错误。\", 'reasoning':

This command provides detailed information about the task, including any errors encountered.\\n\\n### Step 3: Skip the Failed DDL Statement\\nIf it is acceptable to skip the failed DDL statement in the downstream TiDB, use the `binlog skip <task-name>` command. This command allows you to bypass the problematic DDL statement and resume the migration process. Here is an example of how to execute this command:\\n\\n```bash\\n» handle-error test skip\\n```\\n\\nAfter executing the command, you should see a confirmation message indicating that the operation was successful. For more details, refer to the [documentation on handling failed DDL statements](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/handle-failed-ddl-statements).\\n\\n### Step 4: Verify Task Status\\nAfter skipping the DDL statement, use the `query-status <task-name>` command again to verify that the task is running normally. The output should show that the task is in the \"Running\" stage with no unresolved DDL locks or errors.\\n\\n### Step 5: Fallback Instructions\\nIf errors persist after skipping the DDL statement, consider the following fallback options:\\n- **Replace the DDL Statement**: If it is acceptable to replace the failed DDL statement with another, use the `binlog replace <task-name>` command to specify an alternative DDL statement.\\n- **Inject a DDL Statement**: If injecting a new DDL statement is a viable solution, use the `binlog inject <task-name>` command to add the necessary DDL to the downstream TiDB.\\n\\nFor more detailed instructions on these commands, refer to the [TiDB DM documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/handle-failed-ddl-statements).\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can effectively manage and skip failed DDL operations in TiDB DM, ensuring a smooth migration process.', 'reasoning': \"Okay, so I need to update the plan based on the user's suggestions and the current execution state. Let me go through this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, looking at the suggestions, the user wants to add a step to verify the DM version and check the command syntax.

This guidance is applicable to TiDB DM version v8.1 and involves using specific commands to handle failed DDL statements during the migration process.\\n\\n### Steps to Skip a DDL Operation\\n\\n1. **Identify the Failed DDL Statement**:\\n   - When a DDL statement is not supported by TiDB and causes the migration task to be interrupted, you will need to identify the specific DDL statement that has failed. This can be done by checking the error messages in the task status.\\n\\n2. **Use the `binlog skip` Command**:\\n   - Execute the `binlog skip <task-name>` command to skip the currently failed DDL statements in the MySQL instances involved in the migration task. This command is used to bypass the problematic DDL operation and resume the migration process.\\n   - Example command:\\n     ```bash\\n     » binlog skip test\\n     ```\\n   - This command is applicable to all relevant MySQL instances involved in the migration task.\\n\\n3. **Alternative Command - `handle-error test skip`**:\\n   - Alternatively, you can use the `handle-error test skip` command to achieve the same outcome. This command also skips the failed DDL statements, allowing the migration task to continue.\\n   - Example command:\\n     ```bash\\n     » handle-error test skip\\n     ```\\n\\n4. **Verify the Task Status**:\\n   - After executing the skip command, it is crucial to verify that the DDL operation was skipped successfully. Use the `query-status <task-name>` command to check the task status and ensure that the migration task is running normally without errors.\\n   - Example command:\\n     ```bash\\n     » query-status test\\n     ```\\n\\n5. **Post-Operation Verification**:\\n   - Review the task status output to confirm that the task is running and that the problematic DDL statements have been skipped. The output should indicate that the task is in the \"Running\" stage with no unresolved DDL locks.\\n\\n### Additional Considerations\\n\\n- **Version-Specific Guidance**: This process is specific to TiDB DM version v8.1. Ensure that you are using the correct version to avoid compatibility issues.\\n- **Alternative Solutions**: If skipping the DDL operation does not meet your needs, consider using the `replace` command to substitute the problematic DDL with a supported one. Alternatively, manually adjust the schema in the downstream database to align with the desired state.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the official documentation on handling failed DDL statements in TiDB DM: [Handle Failed DDL Statements in TiDB Data Migration](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/handle-failed-ddl-statements).\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can effectively manage and skip unsupported DDL operations during TiDB Data Migration, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted migration process.', 'reasoning': \"Okay, so I need to update the plan based on the user's suggestions and the current execution state. Let me start by understanding what's been done so far and what needs to be changed.\\n\\nFirst, the current plan has three steps. The first step uses `retrieve_knowledge_graph` to get information about TiDB DM's DDL handling. The second step uses `vector_search` to find documentation on skipping DDL operations. The third step synthesizes this information using `llm_generate` to produce a final answer.\\n\\nThe user's suggestions mention that the remaining steps could be improved by adding verification and cross-referencing of command syntax from multiple documentation sources. They also want to clarify the differences between certain commands and ensure the instructions apply to the specific TiDB DM version. Additionally, they suggest confirming that the DDL operation was skipped by checking the task status.\\n\\nSo, I need to incorporate these suggestions into the plan. Let me think about how to do that step by step.\\n\\n1. **Verification of Command Syntax**: After retrieving the documentation, I should verify the command syntax. This might involve checking multiple sources or cross-referencing the information. Maybe I can add a step where `llm_generate` analyzes the retrieved docs to ensure the commands are correct.\\n\\n2. **Clarify Command Differences**: The user mentioned commands like 'binlog skip' and 'handle-error test skip'. I need to make sure the instructions clearly explain these differences. Perhaps adding a step where the LLM clarifies these points based on the retrieved information.\\n\\n3. **Version Confirmation**: The user wants to ensure the guidance applies to their specific TiDB DM version, say v8.1. I should include a step where the plan checks if the documentation applies to that version. Maybe using `llm_generate` to confirm compatibility.\\n\\n4. **Task Status Check**: After skipping the DDL, the user should check the task status. I need to include a step that reminds them to use the appropriate command, like `query-status <task-name>`, and perhaps explain how to interpret the results.\\n\\nNow, looking at the current plan, after step 2, which is the `vector_search`, I can add new steps to address these points.\\n\\nI'll add a step after `vector_search` where `llm_generate` verifies the command syntax and clarifies command differences. Then, another step to confirm the version applicability. Finally, a step to remind about checking the task status.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that each new step correctly references the previous outputs and that the final answer includes all these verified points.\\n\\nI should structure the new steps as `calling` instructions using `llm_generate` with appropriate prompts. Each step will process the existing variables (like `ddl_skipping_docs`) and generate new variables (like `syntax_verification`, `version_confirmation`, `status_check_reminder`) which will then be included in the final synthesis.\\n\\nFinally, the last `llm_generate` step will combine all these pieces into a comprehensive answer, ensuring all user suggestions are addressed.\", 'plan': [{'parameters': {'output_vars': ['ddl_handling_info'], 'tool_name': 'retrieve_knowledge_graph', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB DM DDL handling capabilities and configurations'}}, 'seq_no': 0, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['ddl_skipping_docs'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'How to skip DDL operations in TiDB DM without errors', 'top_k': 10}}, 'seq_no': 1, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['syntax_verification'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': '${ddl_skipping_docs}', 'prompt': \"Verify the command syntax for skipping DDL operations in TiDB DM.
