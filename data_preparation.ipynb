This type of index is particularly useful for optimizing queries that involve multiple conditions, as it allows for efficient retrieval of data based on combinations of column values. By using a composite index, TiDB can perform multi-dimensional queries more efficiently, reducing the need for full table scans and thus improving query performance.\\n\\n### How Composite Indexes Work\\n\\nWhen a composite index is created, TiDB stores the index entries in a way that reflects the order of the columns specified in the index. This means that the index can be used to quickly locate rows that match specific combinations of values across the indexed columns. For example, if you have a table with columns `c1`, `c2`, and `c3`, and you frequently run queries like `SELECT * FROM table WHERE c1 = 10 AND c2 = 100 AND c3 > 10`, creating a composite index on `(c1, c2, c3)` would allow TiDB to efficiently use the index to satisfy the query conditions.\\n\\n### Storage Implications\\n\\nThe storage of composite indexes in TiDB involves maintaining additional data structures that map the combinations of column values to the corresponding rows in the table. This can lead to increased storage requirements, as each index entry must store the values of all the indexed columns. Additionally, when rows are inserted, updated, or deleted, the composite index must be updated accordingly, which can impact write performance.\\n\\nHowever, the performance benefits of using composite indexes often outweigh the storage and maintenance costs, especially for read-heavy workloads where query performance is critical. By reducing the need for full table scans, composite indexes can significantly speed up query execution times.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\nConsider a `books` table with columns `title`, `author`, and `published_at`. If you frequently query this table to find books by a specific author published after a certain date, you might create a composite index on `(author, published_at)`. This index would allow TiDB to quickly locate all books by a given author and then filter them by the publication date, without scanning the entire table.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on best practices for creating and using indexes in TiDB, you can refer to the [Best Practices for Indexing](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/dev-guide-index-best-practice) document.

The task involves two main components: understanding the functionality of composite indexes in TiDB and determining their impact on storage space.\\n\\n1. **Understanding Composite Indexes in TiDB**:\\n   - We need to gather information on how composite indexes function in TiDB.

They are particularly useful for multi-dimensional queries where multiple columns are involved in the search criteria. Here's how they work and their storage implications:\\n\\n### How Composite Indexes Work\\n\\n1. **Index Key Encoding**: \\n   - In TiDB, each composite index is encoded into a key-value pair. The key is constructed using a combination of the table ID, index ID, and the values of the indexed columns. This encoding ensures that all data related to a specific index is stored sequentially in TiKV, TiDB's underlying storage engine.\\n   - The encoding scheme is designed to maintain the order of the indexed columns, which allows for efficient range queries and quick lookups.\\n\\n2. **Variable-Length Fields**:\\n   - TiDB handles variable-length fields by encoding them in a way that preserves their order. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the index and ensuring that queries return the correct results.\\n   - The encoding process involves converting variable-length fields into a fixed format that can be compared and sorted efficiently.\\n\\n3. **Storage Implications**:\\n   - Each composite index adds additional storage overhead because it requires storing the index keys and associated row IDs. This means that the more indexes you have, the more storage space is consumed.\\n   - The storage space required for an index can be estimated by considering the size of the indexed columns and the number of rows in the table. For example, if you have a composite index on three columns, the storage space will be roughly proportional to the combined size of these columns multiplied by the number of rows.\\n\\n### Estimating Storage Space\\n\\nTo estimate the storage space for a composite index, you can use the following method:\\n\\n1. **Calculate the Size of Indexed Columns**: Determine the size of each column in the index. For example, if you have a `VARCHAR(100)` column, it can take up to 100 bytes per row.\\n\\n2. **Multiply by the Number of Rows**: Multiply the total size of the indexed columns by the number of rows in the table to get an estimate of the storage space required for the index.\\n\\n3. **Consider Additional Overhead**: Add some overhead for the index metadata and any additional storage structures used by TiDB.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\nSuppose you have a table with a composite index on three columns: `c1` (INT), `c2` (VARCHAR(50)), and `c3` (DATETIME). If the table has 1 million rows, the storage space for the index can be estimated as follows:\\n\\n- Size of `c1`: 4 bytes\\n- Size of `c2`: Up to 50 bytes\\n- Size of `c3`: 8 bytes\\n\\nTotal size per row for the index: 4 + 50 + 8 = 62 bytes\\n\\nEstimated storage space for the index: 62 bytes * 1,000,000 rows = 62,000,000 bytes (approximately 62 MB)\\n\\n### References\\n\\nFor more detailed information on composite indexes and their implementation in TiDB, you can refer to the following sources:\\n\\n- [Best Practices for Indexing in TiDB](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/dev-guide-index-best-practice)\\n- [TiDB Computing](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-computing)\", 'reasoning': \"Okay, so I need to figure out how to update the current plan based on the suggestions provided.

This type of index is particularly useful for multi-dimensional queries, as it can satisfy both view definitions and query predicates or statement conditions, thereby improving performance by reducing the need for full table scans.\\n\\n### How Composite Indexes Work\\n\\n1. **Index Key Encoding**: \\n   - In TiDB, each index is assigned a unique `IndexID`. The composite index key is constructed by concatenating the `TableID`, `IndexID`, and the values of the indexed columns. This key is then used to store the index in TiKV, TiDB's underlying key-value store.\\n   - The encoding ensures that all rows in a table or all data of a particular index are stored sequentially in TiKV's key space. This ordered storage is crucial for efficient range queries and scans.\\n\\n2. **Variable-Length Fields**:\\n   - When dealing with variable-length fields, TiDB uses a specific encoding scheme to ensure that the pre-encoding and post-encoding comparisons remain consistent. This allows the data to be stored in an ordered manner, which is essential for maintaining the efficiency of the index.\\n\\n3. **Storage Implications**:\\n   - Each additional index, including composite indexes, adds an extra Key-Value pair for each row in the table. This increases the storage space required and can impact write performance, as more data needs to be written to TiKV.\\n   - The storage space used by an index can be estimated by considering the size of the indexed columns and the number of rows. For example, if a composite index is created on three columns, the storage space will be approximately the sum of the sizes of these columns multiplied by the number of rows.\\n\\n### Estimating Storage Space\\n\\nTo estimate the storage space for a composite index, you can use the following method:\\n\\n- **Calculate the Size of Indexed Columns**: Determine the size of each column included in the index. For instance, if you have a `VARCHAR(100)`, an `INT`, and a `DATETIME`, estimate their sizes based on typical data.\\n- **Multiply by Row Count**: Multiply the total size of the indexed columns by the number of rows in the table to get an approximate storage requirement for the index.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\nConsider a table `books` with a composite index on the columns `title`, `type`, and `published_at`. If `title` is a `VARCHAR(100)`, `type` is an `ENUM`, and `published_at` is a `DATETIME`, the storage space for the index can be estimated by summing the sizes of these fields and multiplying by the number of rows.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on best practices for creating and using indexes in TiDB, you can refer to the official documentation: [Best Practices for Indexing](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/dev-guide-index-best-practice).\", 'reasoning': \"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to update the plan based on the suggestions provided.

Also, the final LLM step should include both qualitative and quantitative details, like formulas or rules of thumb for estimating storage space.\\n\\nLooking at the current plan, step 0 retrieves knowledge from the graph, which is good for structured data. Step 1 does a vector search with a broad query, which might not get specific enough details. Step 2 is another vector search for storage implications, which is a good addition.

These indexes are created on multiple columns of a table, enabling multi-dimensional queries. The use of composite indexes can significantly reduce the need for full table scans, thereby improving query performance.\\n\\n### How Composite Indexes Work\\n\\n1. **Index Key Encoding**: \\n   - In TiDB, each composite index is encoded into a key-value pair. The key is constructed using a combination of the table ID, index ID, and the values of the indexed columns. This encoding ensures that the data is stored in an ordered manner, which is crucial for efficient range queries.\\n   - For example, if you have a table with columns `c1`, `c2`, and `c3`, and you create a composite index on these columns, the index key will be encoded as `tablePrefix{TableID}_indexPrefixSep{IndexID}_c1_c2_c3`.\\n\\n2. **Variable-Length Fields**:\\n   - TiDB handles variable-length fields by encoding them in a way that maintains the order of the data. This is important for ensuring that range queries can be executed efficiently.\\n   - The encoding scheme is designed to ensure that comparisons before and after encoding yield the same results, which is essential for maintaining the order of data in the key space.\\n\\n3. **Storage Implications**:\\n   - Each composite index adds additional storage overhead because it requires storing the index keys and associated row IDs. This means that while composite indexes can speed up queries, they also consume more storage space and can slow down write operations due to the additional data that needs to be maintained.\\n   - The storage space required for an index can be estimated by considering the size of the indexed columns and the number of rows in the table. For instance, if each indexed column is 4 bytes and there are 1 million rows, the index would require approximately 4 MB of storage space, not accounting for additional overhead.\\n\\n### Estimating Storage Space\\n\\nTo estimate the storage space for a composite index, you can use the following method:\\n\\n- **Calculate the size of each index entry**: Sum the sizes of the indexed columns. For example, if you have three columns of types INT, VARCHAR(20), and DATE, the approximate size would be 4 bytes (INT) + 20 bytes (VARCHAR) + 3 bytes (DATE) = 27 bytes per entry.\\n- **Multiply by the number of rows**: If your table has 1 million rows, the index would require approximately 27 MB of storage space.\\n- **Consider additional overhead**: Include additional space for metadata and potential padding, which can vary based on the database configuration and the specific data types used.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\nConsider a table `books` with columns `id`, `title`, and `published_at`. If you create a composite index on `title` and `published_at`, the index key would be encoded using the values of these columns. This allows for efficient queries that filter or sort by `title` and `published_at`.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on best practices for creating and using indexes in TiDB, you can refer to the [TiDB documentation on indexing best practices](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/dev-guide-index-best-practice).\\n\\nBy understanding how composite indexes work and their storage implications, you can make informed decisions about when and how to use them to optimize your database performance.', 'reasoning': \"Alright, I need to update the plan based on the suggestions provided.

These indexes are created on multiple columns of a table, enabling multi-dimensional queries. The use of composite indexes can significantly reduce the need for full table scans, thereby improving query performance.\\n\\n### How Composite Indexes Work\\n\\n1. **Index Key Encoding**: \\n   - In TiDB, each composite index is encoded into a key-value pair. The key is constructed using the table ID, index ID, and the values of the indexed columns. This encoding ensures that all data related to a particular index is stored sequentially in TiKV's key space, which is the underlying storage engine for TiDB.\\n   - The encoding scheme is designed to maintain the order of the indexed columns, which allows for efficient range queries and sorting operations.\\n\\n2. **Variable-Length Fields**:\\n   - TiDB handles variable-length fields by encoding them in a way that preserves their order. This is crucial for maintaining the correct sequence of data in the index.\\n   - The encoding process involves converting variable-length fields into a fixed-length format that can be compared lexicographically, ensuring that the order of data is consistent before and after encoding.\\n\\n3. **Storage Implications**:\\n   - Each composite index adds additional storage overhead because it requires storing the index keys and associated row IDs. The more columns included in a composite index, the larger the index key becomes, which can increase storage requirements.\\n   - The storage space used by an index can be estimated by considering the size of the indexed columns and the number of rows in the table. For example, if a table has a composite index on three columns, the storage space required for the index would be approximately the sum of the sizes of these columns multiplied by the number of rows.\\n\\n### Estimating Storage Space\\n\\nTo estimate the storage space for a composite index, you can use the following method:\\n\\n- **Calculate the Size of Indexed Columns**: Determine the size of each column included in the index. For instance, if you have a `VARCHAR(100)` column, it can take up to 100 bytes per row.\\n- **Multiply by Row Count**: Multiply the total size of the indexed columns by the number of rows in the table to get an approximate size of the index.\\n- **Consider Overhead**: Add some overhead for the index structure itself, which includes metadata and additional storage for maintaining the index order.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\nSuppose you have a table with a composite index on columns `A` (INT), `B` (VARCHAR(50)), and `C` (DATETIME). If the table has 1 million rows, the estimated storage space for the index would be:\\n\\n- Size of `A`: 4 bytes\\n- Size of `B`: 50 bytes\\n- Size of `C`: 8 bytes\\n- Total per row: 62 bytes\\n- Total for index: 62 bytes * 1,000,000 rows = 62,000,000 bytes (approximately 62 MB)\\n\\nThis estimation provides a rough idea of the storage space required for the composite index.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on composite indexes and their implementation in TiDB, you can refer to the official documentation: [TiDB Best Practices for Indexing](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/dev-guide-index-best-practice) and [TiDB Computing](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-computing).\", 'reasoning': \"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to update the plan based on the user's suggestions.

The user provided some suggestions to improve the plan, specifically to add more detailed storage implications and ensure the final answer includes both qualitative and quantitative details.\\n\\nI need to assess how these suggestions can be incorporated. The main points are to add more specific vector searches for storage details and modify the LLM prompt to include these details. \\n\\nLooking at the current plan, step 1 does a vector search with a broad query.

This means inserting a new step after step 1. This new step will perform a vector search with a query specifically targeting the internal structure of composite indexes, including how variable-length fields affect storage.\\n\\nThen, I need to modify the final LLM generation step. The prompt should explicitly ask for both the functionality of composite indexes and the quantitative aspects of storage.

They are created on multiple columns of a table, which can significantly reduce the need for full table scans and improve query execution times. Here’s a detailed explanation of how composite indexes work in TiDB, their storage implications, and how to estimate storage space:\\n\\n### How Composite Indexes Work\\n\\n1. **Index Key Encoding**: In TiDB, composite indexes are encoded in a way that maintains the order of the data. This is crucial for efficient range queries. The encoding scheme ensures that the pre-encoding and post-encoding comparisons remain consistent, allowing TiDB to store table data or index data in an ordered manner within TiKV, TiDB's storage engine. This ordered storage is essential for quickly locating rows that match query conditions.\\n\\n2. **Variable-Length Fields**: When dealing with variable-length fields in composite indexes, TiDB carefully designs the encoding scheme to handle these fields efficiently. The encoding ensures that the order of data is preserved, which is important for range queries. This involves using a consistent method to encode variable-length fields so that they can be compared and sorted correctly.\\n\\n3. **Covering Index Optimization**: TiDB uses a technique called covering index optimization, which allows queries to be satisfied directly from the index without accessing the table data. This is particularly useful when all the columns needed by a query are included in the index. By doing so, TiDB can improve query performance by reducing the number of I/O operations required.\\n\\n### Storage Implications\\n\\n1. **Increased Storage Requirements**: Creating composite indexes increases storage requirements because each index adds additional key-value pairs to the database. This can lead to slower write speeds as more data needs to be stored and managed. It's important to balance the number of indexes with the performance benefits they provide.\\n\\n2. **Estimating Storage Space**: To estimate the storage space required for composite indexes, consider the number of columns in the index, the data types of these columns, and the number of rows in the table. Each index entry will include the values of the indexed columns and a reference to the corresponding row. The storage space can be estimated by multiplying the size of each index entry by the number of rows.\\n\\n### Recent Updates and Version-Specific Nuances\\n\\n- **Clustered vs. Non-Clustered Indexes**: TiDB supports both clustered and non-clustered indexes. Clustered indexes store data in a way that the table data is sorted according to the index keys, which can improve performance for certain types of queries, especially those involving range conditions. Non-clustered indexes, on the other hand, store data in an unordered structure and use a unique ROWID for each row. The choice between clustered and non-clustered indexes can affect storage and performance, particularly in terms of network I/O operations. For more information, see the [What's New in TiDB 5.0](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/release-5.0.0).\\n\\n- **Best Practices for Indexing**: It is recommended to create indexes only on columns that are frequently used in queries to improve performance. Avoid creating indexes on columns that are rarely queried, as this can lead to unnecessary storage overhead and slower write speeds. For detailed best practices, refer to the [Best Practices for Indexing](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/dev-guide-index-best-practice).\\n\\nBy understanding these aspects, you can effectively manage composite indexes in TiDB, optimizing both performance and storage.

It can also handle compressed files in formats such as `.gzip`, `.gz`, `.zstd`, `.zst`, and `.snappy`.\\n- **Constraints**: The target tables must be empty before using this method because the import process does not generate change logs, which affects features like changefeed and point-in-time restore.\\n- **Documentation**: For more details, refer to the [TiDB documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/sql-statement-import-into).\\n\\n### 2. LOAD DATA Statement\\n- **Purpose**: This traditional SQL command is used to import data from a file into a table, suitable for smaller datasets and local file imports.\\n- **Flexibility**: It allows specifying columns to be imported, providing flexibility in handling data with different structures.\\n- **Efficiency**: While straightforward, it may not be as efficient as `IMPORT INTO` for very large datasets.\\n- **Supported Formats**: Primarily supports CSV files.\\n- **Documentation**: More information can be found in the [LOAD DATA documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/sql-statement-load-data).\\n\\n### 3. TiDB Cloud Import Options\\n- **User Interface**: TiDB Cloud offers a user-friendly interface for importing data into cloud-hosted TiDB clusters.\\n- **File Upload Limitations**: For local file uploads, there is a limitation of 50 MiB per file. Files exceeding this size must be split into smaller parts, which can be done using utilities like the `split` command on Linux or macOS.\\n- **Supported Formats**: Supports importing local CSV files and files stored in cloud storage services. Compressed files are also supported, which can help reduce data transfer costs and improve efficiency.\\n- **Cluster Types**: TiDB Cloud provides options for both Serverless and managed clusters. Serverless clusters are designed for ease of use and scalability, while managed clusters offer more control and customization options.\\n- **Documentation**: For more details, refer to the [TiDB Cloud documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/tidb-cloud-import-local-files).\\n\\n### Summary\\nThe choice of import method in TiDB depends on several factors, including the size of the dataset, the source of the data, and specific import requirements. For large datasets and cloud storage, the `IMPORT INTO` method is recommended. The `LOAD DATA` statement is suitable for smaller, local imports.

Let me start by understanding what the current plan does and what the user is asking for.\\n\\nThe current plan is designed to determine if the `readpool.storage` parameter can be configured differently on various TiKV nodes in a TiDB cluster. It uses three main steps: reasoning, retrieving knowledge from a graph, vector search for documentation, and then generating a final answer using an LLM.\\n\\nThe user's suggestion is to improve the plan by adding steps to retrieve cluster upgrade documentation, specifically focusing on changes from TiKV 4.0 to 5.0. They also want the final answer to include potential pitfalls and real-world examples.\\n\\nFirst, I'll consider how to incorporate the upgrade documentation. I'll add a new `calling` step using `vector_search` to find relevant documentation on TiKV upgrades, especially around the 4.0 to 5.0 transition. This will help identify any version-specific behaviors or constraints that might affect the configuration of `readpool.storage`.\\n\\nNext, I need to modify the `llm_generate` step.

This way, the final answer will be more comprehensive and useful.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that the new steps are added after the existing ones without disrupting the flow. So, the new `vector_search` for upgrade docs will come after the initial vector search for configuration details. Then, the `llm_generate` step will use both sets of data to produce the final answer.\\n\\nI should check the dependencies to make sure each step correctly references the output variables from previous steps. For example, the upgrade documentation retrieval should store its output in a new variable, which is then included in the `llm_generate` context.\\n\\nFinally, I'll make sure that the plan remains efficient and doesn't include redundant steps. Each new step should directly contribute to achieving the goal by providing additional context or insights that enhance the answer's quality.\\n\\nSo, in summary, the updated plan will include an additional step to retrieve upgrade documentation and adjust the final LLM generation step to incorporate this new information and expand on potential issues and best practices.\", 'plan_commit_hash': '0e310465d0854fda8d7b4fe73e55cc82', 'answers': [{'commit_hash': 'c763984c7ed249a88f0bfc2cfe90d594', 'committed_at': '2025-02-20T06:12:27', 'description': \"Executed seq_no: 3, step: 'calling', tool: llm_generate\", 'seq_no': 3, 'commit_type': 'StepExecution', 'parent_hash': 'f54c5401396b433f91bda66209973c21', 'final_answer': \"The `readpool.storage` parameter in TiKV can indeed be configured differently on various TiKV nodes, but there are specific conditions and limitations to consider.\\n\\nThe `readpool.storage` parameter is part of the configuration that manages the thread pool for read operations in TiKV.

This means that the `readpool.storage` and `readpool.coprocessor` configurations are combined into a single unified thread pool. If your TiKV cluster was upgraded from v4.0 and the `use-unified-pool` configuration of `readpool.storage` was set to `false` before the upgrade, the read requests will continue using separate thread pools. To switch to the unified thread pool, you need to set `readpool.storage.use-unified-pool` to `true`.\\n\\n### Configuration Flexibility\\n\\nWhile the unified thread pool offers a streamlined approach, you can still configure `readpool.storage` differently on various nodes if needed. This flexibility allows for optimization based on the specific workload and resource availability of each node. However, it's crucial to ensure that the configurations are consistent with the overall cluster strategy to avoid performance issues.\\n\\n### Common Pitfalls\\n\\n1. **Inconsistent Configurations**: If nodes are configured inconsistently, it might lead to unexpected performance bottlenecks. For example, if some nodes use the unified thread pool while others do not, it could result in uneven load distribution.\\n\\n2. **Resource Overcommitment**: Overcommitting resources by setting high thread counts can lead to excessive context switching, which degrades performance. It's essential to balance the thread pool size with the available CPU resources.\\n\\n3. **Version-Specific Features**: Ensure that any configuration changes are compatible with the TiKV version in use. Features like automatic adjustment of the UnifyReadPool thread pool size based on CPU usage are available from v6.3.0 onwards, which can be beneficial for clusters with high read loads.\\n\\n### Example Configuration\\n\\nFor a cluster using the unified thread pool, you might configure the `readpool.storage` as follows:\\n\\n```yaml\\nreadpool.storage.use-unified-pool: true\\nreadpool.unified.max-thread-count: 16\\n```\\n\\nThis configuration ensures that all read operations are handled by a unified pool with a maximum of 16 threads, which can be adjusted based on the node's CPU capacity.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on tuning TiKV thread pool performance, you can refer to the official documentation: [Tune TiKV Thread Pool Performance](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tune-tikv-thread-performance).\", 'reasoning': 'Okay, so I need to update the plan based on the suggestions and the current execution state.

This feature can be enabled by setting `readpool.unified.auto-adjust-pool-size` to `true`. This automatic adjustment can be beneficial in environments with varying workloads, allowing each node to dynamically adapt its configuration [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tikv-configuration-file).\\n\\nIn summary, while the `readpool.storage` parameter can be configured differently across TiKV nodes, the introduction of the unified thread pool in version 5.0 and the auto-adjustment feature in version 6.3.0 provide additional options for optimizing performance across a cluster.

This parameter can indeed be configured differently on various TiKV nodes, allowing for flexibility in optimizing performance based on the specific hardware and workload characteristics of each node.\\n\\n### Version-Specific Behaviors and Limitations\\n\\n1. **Unified Thread Pool**: Starting from TiKV version 5.0, all read requests use a unified thread pool by default. This means that both simple and complex read queries are handled by the same pool, which can be beneficial for resource management and performance consistency. However, if your cluster was upgraded from an earlier version where `readpool.storage.use-unified-pool` was set to `false`, you might need to manually enable the unified pool by setting `readpool.storage.use-unified-pool` to `true` to take advantage of this feature. More details can be found in the [TiKV Thread Pool Performance Tuning Guide](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tune-tikv-thread-performance).\\n\\n2. **Auto-Adjustment**: Since version 6.3.0, TiKV supports automatically adjusting the size of the UnifyReadPool based on current CPU usage. This feature can be enabled by setting `readpool.unified.auto-adjust-pool-size` to `true`. This is particularly useful in environments where CPU usage is highly variable, as it allows the system to dynamically allocate resources to maintain optimal performance. For more information, refer to the [TiKV Configuration File](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tune-tikv-thread-performance).\\n\\n### Best Practices and Potential Pitfalls\\n\\n- **Hardware Considerations**: When configuring `readpool.storage`, consider the number of CPU cores and the overall workload of each TiKV node. Nodes with more CPU resources can handle larger thread pools, which can improve throughput for read-heavy workloads.\\n\\n- **Monitoring and Adjustment**: Regularly monitor the performance of your TiKV nodes using tools like Grafana. If you notice that certain nodes are underperforming, consider adjusting the `readpool.storage` settings to better match the node's capabilities and workload.\\n\\n- **Avoiding Configuration Conflicts**: Ensure that any changes to `readpool.storage` are consistent with other related settings, such as `readpool.coprocessor`, to avoid conflicts that could degrade performance.\\n\\n### Real-World Example\\n\\nIn a scenario where a TiKV cluster is deployed across nodes with varying hardware specifications, you might configure `readpool.storage` differently on each node. For instance, on a node with 32 CPU cores, you might set a higher `readpool.storage.normal-concurrency` value to fully utilize the available resources. Conversely, on a node with fewer cores, you would set a lower value to prevent overloading the CPU, ensuring that other critical processes have sufficient resources.\\n\\nBy tailoring the `readpool.storage` configuration to the specific needs and capabilities of each node, you can optimize the performance of your TiKV cluster, ensuring efficient handling of read requests across diverse environments.\", 'reasoning': \"Okay, I need to update the plan based on the user's suggestions.

This parameter is part of the broader `readpool` configuration, which manages the thread pool for handling read requests in TiKV. The ability to configure `readpool.storage` differently on various TiKV nodes depends on the version of TiKV and the specific deployment scenario.\\n\\n### Version-Specific Behaviors and Changes\\n\\n1. **TiKV 4.0**: In this version, the `readpool.storage` parameter could be configured separately for each TiKV node. This allowed for flexibility in tuning the performance of read operations based on the specific workload and hardware characteristics of each node. However, this also meant that administrators needed to carefully manage these configurations to ensure consistent performance across the cluster.\\n\\n2. **TiKV 5.0 and Later**: Starting from TiKV 5.0, the default behavior changed to use a unified thread pool for all read requests. This means that by default, all read operations, whether simple or complex, are handled by a single thread pool, which simplifies configuration and can lead to more balanced resource usage across nodes. However, if a cluster was upgraded from TiKV 4.0 and the `use-unified-pool` configuration of `readpool.storage` was set to `false`, the nodes would continue using separate thread pools unless explicitly changed. To enable the unified thread pool, you would set `readpool.storage.use-unified-pool` to `true` [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tune-tikv-thread-performance).\\n\\n### Potential Pitfalls and Best Practices\\n\\n- **Consistency vs. Flexibility**: While configuring `readpool.storage` differently on various nodes can optimize performance for specific workloads, it can also lead to inconsistencies in performance and complicate cluster management. Using the unified thread pool simplifies this by providing a consistent configuration across all nodes.\\n\\n- **Resource Utilization**: In scenarios where nodes have different hardware capabilities (e.g., varying CPU cores or memory), configuring `readpool.storage` differently might be beneficial. However, this requires careful monitoring to avoid resource contention or underutilization.\\n\\n- **Upgrade Considerations**: When upgrading from TiKV 4.0 to 5.0, it's important to review the `readpool.storage` settings. If the unified pool is not enabled, you may not benefit from the performance improvements and simplifications introduced in later versions.\\n\\n### Real-World Scenarios\\n\\n- **High-Performance Nodes**: In a cluster with heterogeneous nodes, you might configure `readpool.storage` to allocate more threads on high-performance nodes to handle more read requests, while keeping a lower configuration on less powerful nodes.\\n\\n- **Workload-Specific Tuning**: For nodes handling specific types of read-heavy workloads, adjusting `readpool.storage` can help optimize performance. For example, nodes primarily serving analytical queries might benefit from a larger read pool.\\n\\n- **Unified Configuration**: For most deployments, especially those seeking simplicity and ease of management, using the unified thread pool is recommended. This approach reduces the complexity of managing different configurations and helps ensure consistent performance across the cluster.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while `readpool.storage` can be configured differently on various TiKV nodes, the introduction of the unified thread pool in TiKV 5.0 offers a simpler and often more effective approach to managing read operations. Administrators should weigh the benefits of custom configurations against the potential for increased complexity and maintenance overhead.\", 'reasoning': \"Okay, I need to update the plan based on the user's suggestions.

v4.0之前，TiDB仅支持旧的排序规则框架，这意味着虽然可以解析大多数MySQL的排序规则，但实际上所有的排序规则都被视为二进制排序规则。这导致了与MySQL在处理字符串比较时的行为差异。\\n\\n2. **新框架的功能**：自v4.0版本起，TiDB支持一个新的排序规则框架，该框架能够语义上解析不同的排序规则，并严格遵循这些规则进行字符串比较。这使得TiDB在处理字符串比较时与MySQL的行为更加一致。\\n\\n3. **支持的排序规则**：在新框架下，TiDB支持包括`utf8_general_ci`、`utf8mb4_general_ci`、`utf8_unicode_ci`、`utf8mb4_unicode_ci`等在内的多种排序规则。这些排序规则在字符串比较时是大小写不敏感和重音不敏感的。\\n\\n### MySQL的行为\\n\\n在MySQL中，`utf8mb4_general_ci`是一个常用的排序规则，默认情况下是大小写不敏感的。这意味着在进行字符串比较时，`'A'`和`'a'`会被视为相等。MySQL的这种行为在TiDB的新排序规则框架中得到了支持和兼容。\\n\\n### 用户迁移时的兼容性考虑\\n\\n1. **字符集和排序规则的选择**：在从MySQL迁移到TiDB时，用户需要注意字符集和排序规则的选择。由于TiDB默认的排序规则与MySQL不同（TiDB默认使用`utf8mb4_bin`），用户可能需要显式指定排序规则以确保行为一致。\\n\\n2. **连接排序规则的影响**：在TiDB v7.4.0之前，如果客户端使用`utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`作为连接排序规则，TiDB会回退到使用服务器默认的`utf8mb4_bin`。从v7.4.0开始，TiDB会遵循客户端的配置使用`utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`作为默认排序规则。\\n\\n3. **迁移工具的使用**：在迁移过程中，用户可以使用TiDB提供的工具如TiDB Lightning和TiCDC来帮助数据导入和复制，同时需要注意排序规则的兼容性问题。\\n\\n综上所述，`utf8mb4_general_ci`在TiDB的`SHOW COLLATION`输出中不受限制，是因为TiDB的新排序规则框架支持这种排序规则，并且在处理字符串比较时与MySQL的行为保持一致。这为用户从MySQL迁移到TiDB提供了更好的兼容性和便利性。\", 'reasoning':

**默认排序规则**：MySQL 的默认排序规则通常是通用排序规则（如 `_general_ci` 或 `_ai_ci`），而 TiDB 的默认排序规则是二进制排序规则（如 `_bin`）。这可能导致在指定显式字符集但依赖隐式默认排序规则时出现不兼容行为。\\n\\n- **连接排序规则**：MySQL 客户端的连接排序规则会影响 TiDB 的默认排序规则选择。例如，MySQL 8.x 客户端默认使用 `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci` 作为 `utf8mb4` 字符集的连接排序规则。在 TiDB v7.4.0 之前，如果客户端使用该连接排序规则，TiDB 会回退到使用服务器默认的 `utf8mb4_bin` 排序规则。自 v7.4.0 起，TiDB 会遵循客户端的配置。\\n\\n### 用户迁移时的兼容性考虑\\n\\n- **字符集和排序规则的选择**：在从 MySQL 迁移到 TiDB 时，用户需要注意字符集和排序规则的选择，特别是在依赖默认排序规则的情况下。\\n\\n- **排序规则的行为差异**：由于 TiDB 和 MySQL 在排序规则的实现上存在差异，用户在迁移时需要测试和验证应用程序的行为，以确保在 TiDB 上的表现符合预期。\\n\\n总之，`utf8mb4_general_ci` 在 TiDB 的 `SHOW COLLATION`

It helps distribute writes across storage nodes, reducing the risk of write hotspots that can occur with sequential IDs assigned by `AUTO_INCREMENT`. This is especially useful when the primary key is a `BIGINT` type. For more details, you can refer to the [TiDB documentation on AUTO_RANDOM](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/auto-random).\\n\\n2. **Clustered Indexes for Performance**: Implement clustered indexes to improve query performance. Clustered indexes use the primary key as the row identifier, which can significantly reduce the number of reads and writes required for primary key operations. This feature is fully supported in TiDB 5.0 and later versions. However, be cautious of potential write hotspots if using `AUTO_INCREMENT` primary keys. More information can be found in the [TiDB documentation on clustered indexes](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/clustered-indexes).\\n\\n3. **Restrictions and Best Practices**: Be aware of the restrictions associated with `AUTO_RANDOM`. For instance, it can only be used on `BIGINT` primary key columns and is not compatible with `NONCLUSTERED` primary keys. Additionally, you cannot use `ALTER TABLE` to modify the `AUTO_RANDOM` attribute or switch from `AUTO_INCREMENT` to `AUTO_RANDOM` if the maximum value is near the column type's limit. For a comprehensive list of restrictions, see the [TiDB documentation on AUTO_RANDOM](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/auto-random).\\n\\n4. **Explicit Value Insertion**: If you need to insert explicit values into an `AUTO_RANDOM` column, set the `@@allow_auto_random_explicit_insert` system variable to `1`. However, it is generally not recommended to specify values explicitly, as this can prematurely exhaust the range of automatically allocated values.\\n\\n5. **Compatibility Considerations**: Ensure compatibility with other TiDB features and tools. For example, the clustered index feature is compatible with TiDB migration tools like BR, Dumpling, and TiDB Lightning in v5.0 and later versions. However, converting tables between clustered and non-clustered indexes using these tools is not supported. For more compatibility details, refer to the [TiDB documentation on clustered indexes](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/clustered-indexes).\\n\\nBy following these recommendations, you can optimize the performance and manageability of your TiDB tables with `AUTO_RANDOM` primary keys effectively.\", 'reasoning': 'To manage and optimize a clustered table with an AUTO_RANDOM integer primary key in TiDB, we need to focus on understanding the characteristics of clustered tables and the implications of using AUTO_RANDOM keys.

Here are detailed recommendations:\\n\\n### Analyzing Region Boundaries\\n\\n1. **Key Visualizer and TiKV Metrics**:\\n   - Use TiDB's Key Visualizer tool to observe the distribution of data across regions. This tool helps identify hotspots and uneven data distribution, which can lead to performance bottlenecks. For more details, refer to the [Key Visualizer documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/dashboard-key-visualizer).\\n   - Monitor TiKV metrics such as region size, read/write traffic, and split/merge operations to understand the load on each region. This information is crucial for determining where to split regions to balance the load effectively.\\n\\n### Using SPLIT TABLE BY/BETWEEN Commands\\n\\n2. **SPLIT TABLE BY**:\\n   - Use the `SPLIT TABLE BY` command to manually define split points based on your analysis. This command allows you to specify explicit boundaries for regions, which can help distribute the load more evenly across the cluster.\\n   - Example: If your analysis shows that certain ranges of keys are accessed more frequently, you can split the table at these points. For instance:\\n     ```sql\\n     SPLIT TABLE my_table BY (1000), (2000), (3000);\\n     ```\\n\\n3. **SPLIT TABLE BETWEEN**:\\n   - The `SPLIT TABLE BETWEEN` command is useful for creating multiple regions within a specified range. This can be particularly effective if you have identified a large range of keys that are frequently accessed.\\n   - Example:\\n     ```sql\\n     SPLIT TABLE my_table BETWEEN (1000) AND (5000) REGIONS 5;\\n     ```\\n   - This command creates five regions between the specified start and end keys, helping to distribute the load more evenly.\\n\\n### Partitioning Strategies\\n\\n4. **Range Partitioning**:\\n   - Consider using range partitioning if your data has a natural order or if certain ranges of keys are accessed more frequently. This can improve query performance by reducing the amount of data scanned.\\n\\n5. **Hash Partitioning**:\\n   - If your data access patterns are unpredictable or if you have a large number of small transactions, hash partitioning can help distribute the load evenly across all partitions.\\n\\n6. **Hybrid Approaches**:\\n   - In some cases, a combination of range and hash partitioning might be beneficial. For example, you could use range partitioning for the most frequently accessed data and hash partitioning for the rest.\\n\\n### Continuous Monitoring and Adjustment\\n\\n7. **Regular Review**:\\n   - Regularly review performance metrics and adjust the split points and partitioning strategy as needed.

Here are detailed recommendations:\\n\\n### 1. **Data Distribution and Partitioning**\\n\\n- **Random Value Assignment**: Utilize the `AUTO_RANDOM` attribute to assign random and unique values to `BIGINT` columns that are part of the primary key. This randomness helps distribute data evenly across storage nodes, reducing the risk of write hotspots. This is particularly beneficial in scenarios with high write concurrency.\\n\\n- **Shard Bits Configuration**: Set the number of shard bits (`S`) appropriately to balance randomness and available space for auto-increment bits. A good practice is to set `S` to `log(2, x)`, where `x` is the number of storage engines. This configuration ensures that the load is evenly distributed across nodes, maximizing resource utilization.\\n\\n- **Range Parameter (`R`)**: Adjust the range parameter to ensure that the values remain within a manageable range for your application. This is crucial when the application cannot handle a full 64-bit integer, preventing unexpected behaviors.\\n\\n### 2. **Avoiding Hotspots and Configuration Issues**\\n\\n- **Correct Configuration**: Ensure that the shard bits and range are configured correctly to avoid suboptimal data distribution. Too few shard bits might not distribute data evenly, leading to potential hotspots.\\n\\n- **Compatibility and Restrictions**: Be aware of the restrictions associated with `AUTO_RANDOM`, such as compatibility issues with certain indexes and `ALTER TABLE` operations. These restrictions should be considered during database design to avoid operational issues.\\n\\n- **Implicit Allocation and `last_insert_id()`**: Understand that values allocated implicitly to the `AUTO_RANDOM` column affect the `last_insert_id()` function. This behavior should be accounted for in applications that rely on this function to retrieve the last inserted ID.\\n\\n### 3. **Best Practices for Schema Design**\\n\\n- **Clustered Indexes**: When using clustered indexes, consider the implications of using `AUTO_RANDOM` to avoid write hotspots. This approach can retain the benefits of clustered indexes while distributing writes more evenly.\\n\\n- **Switching from `AUTO_INCREMENT`**: If switching from `AUTO_INCREMENT` to `AUTO_RANDOM`, ensure that the primary key is of type `BIGINT` and that the table design accommodates the random nature of `AUTO_RANDOM` values.\\n\\n### 4. **Monitoring and Maintenance**\\n\\n- **Regular Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the distribution of data across nodes to ensure that the configuration remains optimal as the system scales.\\n\\n- **Adjustments and Tuning**: Be prepared to adjust the shard bits and range parameters as the number of storage nodes changes or as application requirements evolve.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on the `AUTO_RANDOM` feature and its configuration, you can refer to the official TiDB documentation:\\n- [TiDB AUTO_RANDOM Documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/auto-random)\\n- [TiDB v8.1 AUTO_RANDOM Documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/auto-random)\\n\\nThese resources provide comprehensive guidance on implementing and managing `AUTO_RANDOM` primary keys in TiDB.\", 'reasoning': \"Okay, I need to update the plan based on the suggestions provided. Let me start by understanding what the current plan does and what the suggestions are asking for.\\n\\nThe current plan is designed to manage and optimize a clustered table with an AUTO_RANDOM integer primary key in TiDB. It uses three main steps: retrieving knowledge graph information, performing a vector search, and generating recommendations using an LLM. However, the suggestions mention that we should add steps to specifically retrieve and analyze the start and end key data. The goal is to better understand how the key range distribution impacts performance and to provide more tailored recommendations.\\n\\nFirst, I'll look at the current plan steps. After the initial assign step, the plan retrieves clustered table info and then does a vector search for AUTO_RANDOM optimization. Then, it generates recommendations based on that information. But it doesn't handle the start and end key data specifically.\\n\\nThe suggestions propose adding steps to extract these boundary keys and analyze their impact. So, I need to introduce new steps to retrieve and analyze the start and end keys. This could involve using the knowledge graph or vector search to get this data.\\n\\nI should also modify the llm_generate step to include guidance on using the key range information. This might involve adjusting the prompt to include details about the start and end keys and how they affect distribution and potential hotspots.\\n\\nLooking at the tools available, I can use 'retrieve_knowledge_graph' and 'vector_search' to get the necessary data. Then, I can use 'llm_generate' to process this data and create recommendations.\\n\\nI need to ensure that each new step contributes directly to the goal. So, adding a step to retrieve the key data and another to analyze it makes sense. Then, updating the existing llm_generate step to incorporate this analysis will provide more comprehensive recommendations.\\n\\nI also need to maintain the correct variable references and ensure that the plan remains efficient. Adding too many steps might complicate the plan, but since the suggestions are focused, it should be manageable.\\n\\nNow, I'll outline the changes:\\n\\n1. After retrieving clustered table info, add a step to retrieve start and end key data using 'retrieve_knowledge_graph'.\\n2. Add another step to analyze how these keys affect data distribution and performance.\\n3. Modify the llm_generate step to include this analysis in its prompt, ensuring that the recommendations consider the key range.\\n\\nThis way, the plan becomes more comprehensive, addressing the specific needs of the user regarding the key data.\\n\\nI should also check that the final answer variable is correctly assigned and that the plan doesn't reference variables that haven't been defined yet. Since the current program counter is at step 1, I'll start adding new steps after that.\\n\\nFinally, I'll ensure that the updated plan follows the VM specification, including correct seq_no ordering and proper use of variables.\", 'plan': [{'parameters': {'goal': 'Manage and optimize a clustered table with an AUTO_RANDOM integer primary key in TiDB, focusing on the provided start and end key data.'}, 'seq_no': 0, 'type': 'assign'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['clustered_table_info'], 'tool_name': 'retrieve_knowledge_graph', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB clustered tables and AUTO_RANDOM primary keys'}}, 'seq_no': 1, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['start_end_key_data'], 'tool_name': 'retrieve_knowledge_graph', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB AUTO_RANDOM primary key start and end key data'}}, 'seq_no': 2, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['auto_random_docs'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB AUTO_RANDOM primary key optimization', 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 3, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['key_range_analysis'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': 'Start and End Key Data: ${start_end_key_data}', 'prompt': 'Analyze the provided start and end key data to evaluate the distribution and potential impact on data partitioning and performance.

The suggestion is to insert new steps after each retrieval to extract and summarize key points from MySQL's information schema. This will help in identifying MySQL-specific features that might not be present in TiDB.\\n\\nSo, after step 2 (retrieving MySQL's vector search results), I'll add a step to extract specific details like user tables, privilege tables, and system variables.

   table_name;\\n   ```\\n\\n   在使用上述查询时，需要替换 `@dbname` 和 `@table_name` 为实际的数据库名和表名。\\n\\n2. **理解查询结果**：\\n   - `Approximate_Size` 表示在压缩前表的近似大小。\\n   - `Disk_Size` 表示压缩后的表大小，计算基于 `Approximate_Size` 和 `store_size_amplification`（集群压缩比的平均值）。\\n\\n3. **检查单个 KV 服务器的数据目录大小的有效性**：\\n   - 检查单个 KV 服务器的数据目录大小可以帮助识别存储不平衡的问题，但这并不能准确反映表的实际大小，因为数据在 TiDB 中是分布式存储的。\\n   - 通过查看每个节点的存储使用情况，可以识别出潜在的热点或不平衡问题，但这需要结合 TiDB 的数据分布和调度策略来进行全面分析。\\n\\n综上所述，虽然检查单个 KV 服务器的数据目录大小可以提供一些有用的信息，但要准确评估表的大小和存储效率，仍需依赖于 TiDB 提供的工具和查询方法。', 'reasoning':

可以使用SQL语句从`information_schema.TIKV_REGION_STATUS`中获取每个表的Region信息。通过计算这些Region的大小，可以估算出表的大小。\\n   - 具体的SQL查询如下：\\n     ```sql\\n     SELECT\\n       db_name,\\n       table_name,\\n       ROUND(SUM(total_size / cnt), 2) AS Approximate_Size,\\n       ROUND(\\n         SUM(\\n           total_size / cnt / (\\n             SELECT\\n               ROUND(AVG(value), 2)\\n

          region_id\\n       ) AS tabinfo\\n     GROUP BY\\n       db_name,\\n       table_name;\\n     ```\\n   - 其中，`Approximate_Size`表示压缩前的表大小，`Disk_Size`表示压缩后的表大小。\\n\\n2. **理解数据分布和压缩**：\\n   - `store_size_amplification`表示集群的平均压缩比，可以通过Grafana监控面板查看每个节点的“Size amplification”指标。\\n\\n### TiDB的分布式特性\\n\\n1. **数据分布**：\\n   - TiDB将数据分割成多个Region，每个Region默认大小为96MB。这些Region被分布在不同的TiKV节点上。\\n   - Region是TiDB中数据存储的基本单位，TiDB通过Placement Driver (PD)来管理Region的分布和调度，以确保读写负载的均衡。\\n\\n2. **数据迁移和负载均衡**：\\n   - TiDB会自动监控各个Region的负载情况，并在必要时进行Region的重新分配，以避免某个节点成为性能瓶颈。\\n   - 当某个Region的读写压力过大时，TiDB可以通过Follower Read功能将读取请求分散到多个Follower节点，从而减轻Leader节点的负载。\\n\\n3. **数据的高可用性**：\\n   - TiDB使用Raft共识算法在多个TiKV节点之间冗余复制数据，以确保在节点故障时的数据可恢复性。\\n   - 每个Region有一个Leader和多个Follower，数据的写入操作首先在Leader上进行，然后同步到Follower。\\n\\n### 检查单个KV服务器的数据目录大小的有效性\\n\\n检查单个KV服务器的数据目录大小可以帮助识别存储不均衡的问题，但由于TiDB的数据是分布式存储的，仅检查单个节点的数据目录大小可能无法全面反映整个集群的数据分布情况。因此，建议结合使用TiDB的监控工具（如Grafana）和SQL查询来获取更全面的数据分布和存储信息。\\n\\n综上所述，TiDB的分布式架构和自动化的数据管理机制使得数据的存储和管理更加灵活和高效。通过合理使用TiDB提供的工具和功能，可以有效地监控和管理数据的大小和分布。', 'reasoning': '嗯，我现在需要分析用户的请求，帮助他们更新一个关于TiDB数据大小计算的计划。让我先仔细看看用户提供的信息。\\n\\n首先，用户的目标是了解TiDB如何计算结构化数据的大小，并询问是否可以通过检查单个KV服务器的数据目录来测量。背景是TiDB的存储架构和数据在KV服务器上的分布。用户已经提供了一个当前的执行计划，包括一些步骤，如检索知识图谱、向量搜索和生成最终答案。\\n\\n接下来，用户给出了一个建议，指出可以在现有步骤基础上增加一个整合和高亮TiDB分布式存储特性的步骤，例如强调每个KV节点只存储数据的一部分，以及数据在多个节点间的迁移和负载均衡机制。此外，建议在生成答案时明确引用从知识图谱和向量检索中获得的具体信息，以更详细地解释为什么单一KV节点的数据目录大小不足以全面反映整个集群的数据情况。\\n\\n我的任务是根据这些建议和当前的执行结果，分析并更新计划。我需要确保更新后的计划符合VM的规范，包括保持原有的步骤不变，从当前的程序计数器开始添加新的步骤。\\n\\n首先，我需要理解当前计划的结构。当前计划有四个步骤，其中步骤0是推理，步骤1是检索知识图谱，步骤2是向量搜索，步骤3是生成最终答案。当前程序计数器在步骤1，所以接下来的步骤需要从步骤2开始添加。\\n\\n根据建议，我需要添加一个新的步骤，用于整合和高亮TiDB的分布式存储特性。这可能涉及到使用assign指令来创建一个结构化的变量，或者在生成最终答案时引用更多的信息。\\n\\n另外，建议中提到在生成答案时引用具体的信息，因此可能需要调整步骤3的参数，使其能够引用更多的变量，比如从知识图谱和向量搜索中获取的信息。\\n\\n考虑到VM的规范，所有步骤必须按顺序执行，变量必须正确引用，且最终答案的变量名称必须是“final_answer”。\\n\\n现在，我需要考虑如何将这些建议整合到当前的计划中。可能的步骤包括：\\n\\n1. 在步骤2之后添加一个新的步骤，使用assign指令来整合TiDB的分布式存储特性，例如创建一个变量，说明每个KV节点仅存储数据的一部分，并涉及数据迁移和负载均衡机制。\\n\\n2.

'在TiDB中，计算结构化数据的大小可以通过查询TiKV的Region状态来实现。TiDB是一个分布式数据库系统，其数据存储在多个TiKV节点上。每个TiKV节点仅存储数据的一部分，这些数据被分割成多个Region。Region是TiDB中数据分布的基本单位，通常大小为96MB。TiDB通过Placement Driver (PD)来管理这些Region的分布和调度，以确保读写压力的均衡分布。\\n\\n要估算TiDB中某个表的数据大小，可以使用以下SQL查询：\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT\\n  db_name,\\n  table_name,\\n  ROUND(SUM(total_size / cnt), 2) AS Approximate_Size,\\n  ROUND(\\n    SUM(\\n      total_size / cnt / (\\n        SELECT\\n          ROUND(AVG(value), 2)\\n        FROM\\n          METRICS_SCHEMA.store_size_amplification\\n        WHERE\\n          value > 0\\n

region_id\\n  ) AS tabinfo\\nGROUP BY\\n  db_name,\\n  table_name;\\n```\\n\\n在这个查询中，`Approximate_Size`表示在压缩前的表大小，而`Disk_Size`表示压缩后的表大小。`store_size_amplification`用于表示集群的平均压缩比。\\n\\nTiDB的分布式特性体现在其数据的分布和调度机制上。数据在多个节点间的迁移和负载均衡是通过PD组件来实现的。PD负责监控集群的状态，并根据需要自动重新平衡Region，以避免某个节点成为性能瓶颈。这种机制确保了系统的高可用性和高性能。\\n\\n检查单个KV服务器的数据目录大小可以作为一种有效的手段来了解该节点上存储的数据量。然而，由于数据在多个节点间的分布和动态迁移，仅检查单个节点的数据目录大小可能无法全面反映整个集群的数据分布情况。因此，结合使用TiDB提供的SQL查询和监控工具（如Grafana）来获取更全面的数据分布信息是非常重要的。',

Diese Architektur ermöglicht es TiDB, Daten schnell und zuverlässig zu speichern und zu replizieren, selbst bei Ausfällen einzelner Maschinen. Die Fähigkeit, Replikate automatisch zu vervollständigen, ohne die Anwendung zu beeinträchtigen, ist ein wesentlicher Vorteil von TiDB.\\n\\n**Suchleistung und Abfrageverarbeitung**\\n\\nTiDB bietet eine hohe Leistung bei der Abfrageverarbeitung, die durch mehrere Faktoren unterstützt wird:\\n\\n1. **Indizes und Abfrageoptimierung**: TiDB verwendet Indizes, um die Suchleistung zu verbessern. Die Optimierung von Abfragen erfolgt durch Join-Reorder-Algorithmen, die die Effizienz der Abfrageverarbeitung weiter steigern.\\n\\n2. **Vektorsuche**: TiDB unterstützt die Erstellung von Indizes für die Vektorsuche, was die Suchleistung in bestimmten Anwendungsfällen, wie z.B. bei der Verarbeitung von großen Datenmengen oder komplexen Abfragen, weiter verbessern kann.\\n\\n3. **ACID-Transaktionen**: Die Unterstützung von ACID-Transaktionen macht TiDB besonders geeignet für Szenarien, die starke Konsistenz erfordern, wie z.B. Banküberweisungen. Dies gewährleistet, dass alle Transaktionen atomar, konsistent, isoliert und dauerhaft sind.\\n\\n**Vergleich mit anderen Datenbanksystemen**\\n\\nIm Vergleich zu anderen modernen verteilten Datenbanksystemen bietet TiDB eine vergleichbare oder sogar überlegene Suchleistung.

**创建放置策略**：首先，您需要创建一个放置策略，指定主数据所在的区域和同步的目标区域。在这个例子中，主数据位于西雅图（us-west-2），并同步到东京（ap-northeast-1）。您可以使用以下SQL命令：\\n\\n   ```sql\\n   CREATE PLACEMENT POLICY seattle_to_tokyo PRIMARY_REGION=\"us-west-2\" REGIONS=\"us-west-2,ap-northeast-1\" FOLLOWERS=2;\\n   ```\\n\\n   在这个命令中，`PRIMARY_REGION`指定了主数据所在的区域，`REGIONS`指定了数据同步的目标区域，`FOLLOWERS=2`表示在东京有两个副本。\\n\\n2. **应用放置策略到表**：接下来，您需要将创建的放置策略应用到具体的表上。例如，您可以将其应用到名为`example_table`的表：\\n\\n   ```sql\\n   CREATE TABLE example_table (id INT PRIMARY KEY, data VARCHAR(100)) PLACEMENT POLICY=seattle_to_tokyo;\\n   ```\\n\\n通过以上步骤，您可以在TiDB中实现数据在西雅图和东京之间的同步和高可用性配置。这种配置确保了数据的主副本位于西雅图，并在东京保持两个副本，以提高数据的可用性和可靠性。\\n\\n有关更多详细信息，您可以参考TiDB官方文档：[TiDB Placement Rules in

Examples include `COLUMN_PRIVILEGES`, `GLOBAL_STATUS`, and `PLUGINS`. This is consistent across different TiDB deployments, including serverless options.\\n   - **Caching Behaviors**: The information schema cache in TiDB is used to store metadata about the database schema to improve query performance.

This is due to the serverless architecture, which prioritizes scalability and resource efficiency over full feature parity with dedicated deployments.\\n\\n2. **Metadata Handling**: TiDB Serverless automatically manages metadata to ensure efficient operation and scaling. This includes handling metadata caching to reduce query latency, although cache misses can still occur, potentially increasing latency for certain operations.\\n\\n3. **Multi-Tenancy**: As a serverless offering, TiDB Serverless is designed for multi-tenancy, meaning that resources are shared among multiple users. This can affect how metadata is accessed and managed, as the system must ensure isolation and security between different tenants.\\n\\n4. **Automatic Upgrades**: TiDB Serverless clusters are automatically upgraded as new versions of TiDB are released. This means that users do not have control over the version of TiDB running in their serverless clusters, which can impact the availability of certain Information Schema features.\\n\\nFor more detailed information about the Information Schema in TiDB Serverless, you can refer to the official documentation: [Information Schema in TiDB](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/information-schema).\\n\\nAdditionally, for specific limitations and quotas related to TiDB Cloud Serverless, you can visit: [TiDB Cloud Serverless Limitations and Quotas](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/serverless-limitations).\", 'reasoning': 'Alright, I need to update the plan based on the user\\'s suggestions.

This compatibility ensures that applications and tools that work with MySQL can easily interact with TiDB Serverless without significant modifications.\\n\\n3. **Multi-Tenancy**: In a serverless environment, multi-tenancy is a critical feature. The information schema in TiDB Serverless is designed to handle multiple tenants efficiently, ensuring that metadata is isolated and secure for each tenant. This isolation is crucial for maintaining data privacy and security in a shared environment.\\n\\n4. **Caching Behavior**: TiDB Serverless employs caching mechanisms to improve the performance of metadata queries. By caching frequently accessed metadata, the system can reduce the load on the underlying storage and provide faster responses to metadata queries. This is particularly important in a serverless context, where resources are dynamically allocated and optimized for cost and performance.\\n\\n### Serverless-Specific Limitations and Differences\\n\\n- **Resource Constraints**: In a serverless environment, there are inherent resource constraints due to the dynamic allocation of resources. This can affect the performance of metadata queries, especially if they are complex or involve large datasets.\\n\\n- **Dynamic Scaling**: Unlike traditional TiDB Cloud deployments, TiDB Serverless can scale resources dynamically based on demand. This means that the information schema must be able to handle changes in the underlying infrastructure without affecting the accuracy or availability of metadata.\\n\\n- **Unique Metadata Handling**: TiDB Serverless may implement unique strategies for handling metadata to optimize for the serverless architecture. This could include more aggressive caching strategies or optimizations for metadata retrieval to ensure that the system remains responsive under varying loads.\\n\\nIn summary, the information schema in TiDB Serverless is a critical component that provides essential metadata about the database environment. It is designed to be compatible with MySQL, support multi-tenancy, and optimize for the unique challenges of a serverless architecture. These features ensure that users can effectively manage and interact with their databases in a scalable and efficient manner.\", 'reasoning': 'Okay, so I need to update the plan based on the user\\'s suggestions. Let me go through the problem step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the goal is to explain the information schema in TiDB Serverless, including its purpose and functionality. The user suggested adding a step to retrieve serverless-specific nuances and modifying the final LLM generation to highlight these aspects.\\n\\nLooking at the current plan, it has four steps: reasoning, retrieving knowledge graph data, vector search for general info, another vector search for serverless nuances, and then generating the final answer. The user\\'s suggestion is to add an integration step after the initial retrievals to synthesize the information before generating the final answer.\\n\\nSo, I need to insert a new step after step 3. This step should combine the knowledge graph data, the general documents, and the serverless-specific documents into a single context. This will ensure that the final LLM generation has all the necessary information in one place, making the explanation more coherent.\\n\\nI\\'ll use the \"assign\" instruction type for this new step.

The new step will create a variable, say \"synthesized_context\", which will be used in the final LLM generation. This variable will combine \"info_schema_graph\", \"info_schema_docs\", and \"serverless_nuances_docs\".\\n\\nI should check that all variables are properly referenced and that the plan remains efficient.

It offers an ANSI-standard way to view system metadata, including information about tables, views, and other database objects. In TiDB Serverless, the Information Schema functions similarly to other TiDB deployment models, but with some specific considerations and limitations.\\n\\n### Functionality in TiDB Serverless\\n\\n1. **Metadata Management**: The Information Schema in TiDB Serverless provides insights into the database's structure and configuration. It includes tables that offer information on table partitions, process lists, and user privileges, among others. However, some tables that are available in other TiDB deployments might not be supported in the serverless model, returning zero rows instead.\\n\\n2. **Caching Benefits**: TiDB Serverless benefits from the underlying cloud infrastructure, which can offer caching mechanisms to improve performance. This is particularly useful for metadata queries that are frequently accessed, as it can reduce latency and improve response times.\\n\\n3. **Potential Limitations**: TiDB Serverless has specific limitations compared to other TiDB deployment models. For instance, certain system tables and features might not be fully supported or available. This is due to the serverless architecture, which prioritizes scalability and resource efficiency over the full feature set available in dedicated deployments. For example, tables related to cluster configuration and slow queries might not be supported in the serverless environment.\\n\\n4. **Scalability and Resource Management**: One of the key aspects of TiDB Serverless is its ability to automatically scale resources based on workload demands. This means that while the Information Schema provides metadata insights, the underlying resources can dynamically adjust, which might affect how metadata is accessed and managed.\\n\\n### Comparison with Other TiDB Deployment Models\\n\\n- **Dedicated vs. Serverless**: In dedicated TiDB deployments, the Information Schema is fully supported with all tables available, providing comprehensive metadata management. In contrast, TiDB Serverless might have limited support for certain tables due to its focus on scalability and cost efficiency.\\n\\n- **Caching and Performance**: While both deployment models can benefit from caching, the serverless model leverages cloud-native caching solutions to optimize performance without manual intervention. This can lead to differences in how quickly metadata queries are resolved.\\n\\n- **Limitations and Quotas**: TiDB Serverless has specific limitations and quotas that are not present in dedicated deployments. These include restrictions on the number of clusters and the amount of data that can be stored or processed, which can impact how the Information Schema is utilized.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on the Information Schema in TiDB and its specific tables, you can refer to the official documentation [here](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/information-schema). Additionally, for insights into the limitations and quotas of TiDB Cloud Serverless, you can visit [this page](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/serverless-limitations).\", 'reasoning': \"Okay, so I need to figure out how to update the plan based on the suggestions provided. Let me start by understanding what the original plan does and what the suggestions are asking for.\\n\\nThe original plan is designed to explain the information schema in TiDB Serverless. It uses three main steps: retrieve knowledge graph data, perform a vector search for detailed documentation, and then generate a final answer using an LLM. The steps are structured to gather information and then synthesize it into a comprehensive explanation.\\n\\nNow, looking at the suggestions, the main points are to ensure that the plan specifically addresses the serverless nuances. The suggestions mention adding checks for serverless-specific differences, modifying the vector search to include serverless-related keywords, and enhancing the LLM prompt to compare TiDB Serverless with other deployment models.\\n\\nSo, the first thing I need to do is incorporate these changes into the plan without altering the initial steps that have already been executed. The plan starts with a reasoning step (seq_no 0), followed by retrieve_knowledge_graph (seq_no 1), vector_search (seq_no 2), and then llm_generate (seq_no 3). The current program counter is at 1, meaning the next step to execute is seq_no 1.\\n\\nThe suggestions ask to add a step to verify that the retrieved knowledge graph and vector search results cover serverless-specific details. This means I need to insert a new step after the initial data retrieval but before generating the final answer. However, since the program counter is at 1, I need to adjust the plan starting from there.\\n\\nI think the best approach is to modify the existing steps to include the serverless-specific parameters. For example, updating the vector_search to include keywords like 'serverless metadata management' and 'serverless architecture differences'. Additionally, the llm_generate prompt should be adjusted to explicitly compare TiDB Serverless with other deployment models and ensure all serverless-specific aspects are covered.\\n\\nBut wait, the user's instructions mention that all steps up to and including step 0 should remain unchanged. So, I need to modify the subsequent steps starting from seq_no 1 onwards. However, the current plan has seq_no 1 as retrieve_knowledge_graph, which is already executed. Therefore, any changes should start from the next available seq_no, which is 4, but that's beyond the current plan.\\n\\nHmm, perhaps I should restructure the plan to include the new steps after the initial data retrieval. But since the program counter is at 1, I can't go back. So, maybe I need to add new steps after the existing ones. Let me outline the steps I need to add:\\n\\n1. After retrieve_knowledge_graph (seq_no 1), add a step to check if the knowledge graph data includes serverless-specific information.\\n2. Modify the vector_search (seq_no 2) to include serverless-related keywords.\\n3. After vector_search, add a step to check if the documents retrieved cover serverless nuances.\\n4. Modify the llm_generate (seq_no 3) to include a comparison with other deployment models and ensure all serverless aspects are addressed.\\n\\nBut considering the program counter is at 1, I need to adjust the plan starting from seq_no 1. However, since seq_no 1 has already been executed, I can't change it. Therefore, I need to insert new steps after seq_no 3.\\n\\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently. The plan needs to be updated starting from the current program counter, which is 1. So, the next steps to execute are seq_no 1, 2, and 3. I need to modify these steps to incorporate the suggestions.\\n\\nFor seq_no 1, I can't change it because it's already been executed. So, I'll leave it as is. For seq_no 2, I can modify the vector_search parameters to include serverless keywords. Then, after seq_no 3, I can add new steps to check the results and ensure serverless specifics are covered.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps I should add a new step after seq_no 3 to perform these checks and modifications. But the user's instructions say to keep all steps up to and including step 0 unchanged, so I can't alter the existing steps beyond that.\\n\\nI think the best approach is to modify the vector_search and llm_generate steps to include serverless-specific parameters and then add a new step to verify the results. Let me outline the changes:\\n\\n- Modify seq_no 2's vector_search to include serverless-related keywords.\\n- Modify seq_no 3's llm_generate prompt to include serverless comparisons.\\n- Add a new step after seq_no 3 to check if the final answer covers serverless aspects.\\n\\nBut since the program counter is at 1, I need to ensure that the updated plan starts from there. So, the plan will have the existing steps 0, 1, 2, 3, and then add new steps 4 and 5 as needed.\\n\\nWait, but the user's instructions say to keep all steps up to and including step 0 unchanged. So, I can't modify step 0, but I can modify steps 1, 2, 3, and add new steps after that.\\n\\nSo, the updated plan will have:\\n\\n- Step 0: unchanged.\\n- Step 1: retrieve_knowledge_graph as before.\\n- Step 2: modified vector_search with serverless keywords.\\n- Step 3: modified llm_generate with enhanced prompt.\\n- Step 4: a new assign step to check if the final answer includes serverless specifics.\\n- Step 5: a jmp instruction to handle any missing information.\\n\\nBut I'm not sure if that's the most efficient way. Alternatively, perhaps I can combine the checks into the llm_generate step to avoid adding too many steps.\\n\\nIn the end, I think the key changes are:\\n\\n1. Modify the vector_search to include serverless-related keywords.\\n2. Enhance the llm_generate prompt to explicitly address serverless nuances and compare with other models.\\n3. Add a verification step to ensure all aspects are covered.\\n\\nSo, the updated plan will include these changes, starting from the current program counter.\", 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': 'To understand the information schema in TiDB Serverless, we will first gather structured information about its purpose and role using the knowledge graph.

It has four steps: a reasoning step, a knowledge graph retrieval, a vector search, and an LLM generation to produce the final answer. The current program counter is at step 2, meaning steps 0 and 1 have already been executed.\\n\\nThe suggestions mention adding edge cases, verifying the TiDB version, and expanding on transaction modes.

The locks are held until the transaction is either committed or rolled back.\\n\\n2. **Current Read**: The `SELECT FOR UPDATE` statement performs a current read, meaning it reads the latest committed version of the data and locks it. This ensures that any changes made by other transactions are not visible until the lock is released.\\n\\n3. **Transaction Mode Considerations**: \\n   - In the optimistic transaction mode, `SELECT FOR UPDATE` does not lock the data at the start of the transaction. Instead, it checks for conflicts at the commit phase. If conflicts are detected, the transaction is rolled back.\\n   - In the pessimistic transaction mode, the behavior is similar to other databases like MySQL, where the locks are applied immediately.\\n\\n4. **Limitations and Considerations**:\\n   - Auto-committed `SELECT FOR UPDATE` statements in TiDB do not wait for locks, which is a known incompatibility with MySQL. To address this, it is recommended to use explicit `BEGIN; COMMIT;` statements to ensure that locks are properly acquired and held until the transaction is completed.\\n   - TiDB does not support gap locking, which is a technique used in some databases to prevent phantom reads by locking ranges of rows. This means that while row-level locks are applied, range locks are not available, which could lead to different behavior compared to databases that support gap locking.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on how TiDB handles `SELECT FOR UPDATE` and row-level locking, you can refer to the following sources:\\n- [TiDB Pessimistic Transaction Mode](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/pessimistic-transaction)\\n- [SQL Statement: SELECT](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/sql-statement-select)\", 'reasoning': \"To address the goal of understanding which rows the `FOR UPDATE` clause locks in TiDB, we need to explore TiDB's implementation of row-level locking.

This behavior is particularly relevant in the context of TiDB's support for both pessimistic and optimistic transaction modes.\\n\\n### Row-Level Locking with `FOR UPDATE`\\n\\n1. **Pessimistic Transaction Mode**:\\n   - In this mode, `FOR UPDATE` locks the rows immediately when the statement is executed. This ensures that no other transaction can modify the locked rows until the transaction is either committed or rolled back. This behavior is similar to traditional databases like MySQL.\\n   - Locks are held until the transaction is completed, providing a high level of data consistency and preventing concurrent modifications.\\n\\n2. **Optimistic Transaction Mode**:\\n   - In contrast, the optimistic mode does not lock rows immediately. Instead, it checks for conflicts at the time of transaction commit. If a conflict is detected (i.e., another transaction has modified the data since it was read), the transaction will fail and must be retried.\\n   - This mode is designed to provide higher concurrency and is suitable for environments where conflicts are rare.\\n\\n### Autocommit Behavior\\n\\n- In TiDB, auto-committed `SELECT FOR UPDATE` statements do not wait for locks, which is a known incompatibility with MySQL. To avoid this issue, it is recommended to use explicit `BEGIN; COMMIT;` statements to ensure that locks are properly managed and waited upon. This behavior can lead to unexpected results if not properly managed with explicit transaction boundaries [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/dev-guide-transaction-restraints).\\n\\n### Edge Cases and Considerations\\n\\n- **Deadlocks**: If several transactions are trying to acquire each other's respective locks, a deadlock will occur. TiDB automatically detects this and randomly terminates one of the transactions, returning a MySQL-compatible error code `1213`.\\n- **Lock Wait Timeout**: Transactions will wait up to a specified timeout (default: 50 seconds) to acquire new locks. If this timeout is reached, a MySQL-compatible error code `1205` is returned.\\n- **NOWAIT Option**: TiDB supports the `FOR UPDATE NOWAIT` syntax, which does not block and wait for locks to be released. Instead, it returns an error if the lock cannot be acquired immediately.\\n\\n### Recent Changes and Default Settings\\n\\n- Starting from TiDB v3.0.8, newly created clusters use the pessimistic transaction mode by default. This change was made to align TiDB's behavior more closely with traditional databases and reduce migration costs. However, this default setting does not affect existing clusters upgraded from earlier versions [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/pessimistic-transaction).\\n\\nFor more detailed information on TiDB's transaction modes and locking behavior, you can refer to the official documentation on [TiDB Pessimistic Transaction Mode](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/pessimistic-transaction) and [Transaction Restraints](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/dev-guide-transaction-restraints).\", 'reasoning': \"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to update the plan based on the user's suggestions.

It starts by retrieving knowledge from the knowledge graph and vector search. Then, it uses `llm_generate` to check for edge cases and transaction details. After that, it cross-references release notes and finally generates the answer. \\n\\nThe user's suggestions want to expand on edge cases, autocommit behavior, and ensure the latest release notes are included. They also mentioned adding a dedicated step for documentation retrieval regarding auto-commit and edge cases. \\n\\nSo, I should add a new step after fetching the knowledge graph and vector search results. This step will retrieve specific documentation or release notes about auto-commit behavior and edge cases. I'll use `vector_search` with a focused query to get the most relevant snippets. \\n\\nNext, I'll modify the existing `llm_generate` steps to include more detailed prompts. For edge cases, I'll ask about scenarios like no matching rows and how TiDB behaves in both pessimistic and optimistic modes. For transaction details, I'll compare the two modes, including autocommit, and any recent changes. \\n\\nI'll also ensure that the release notes check is thorough by explicitly asking about recent updates.

Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I know that in SQL, inserting a NULL value is usually straightforward. You just use the keyword NULL in your INSERT statement. But since the user is specifically asking about TiDB, I should consider any TiDB-specific behaviors or requirements.\\n\\nI remember that TiDB is compatible with MySQL, so most MySQL operations should work similarly. However, it's always good to double-check for any differences. I should look into TiDB's documentation or any known behaviors regarding NULL values in DATETIME columns.\\n\\nAnother thing to consider is the SQL mode settings in TiDB. Some SQL modes might affect how NULL values are handled. For example, if the NO_ZERO_DATE mode is enabled, inserting NULL into a DATETIME column might cause an error. I should include this information so the user knows to check their SQL settings.\\n\\nAlso, it's important to note whether the DATETIME column allows NULLs. If the column is defined with NOT NULL, inserting NULL will result in an error. I should remind the user to check the table schema and provide an example of how to create a DATETIME column that allows NULLs.\\n\\nIncluding code examples would be helpful.

Delaying leader elections can affect the responsiveness of the cluster in handling failures.\\n  - **Testing in Non-Production Environment:** Implement these changes in a staging or test environment first. Monitor the behavior of the cluster to ensure that the configurations achieve the desired effect without introducing new issues.\\n  - **Monitoring:** Use monitoring tools like Grafana to keep an eye on the leader distribution and election times across regions to ensure that the changes are effective.\\n\\nBy following these steps and recommendations, you can effectively delay or prevent Region 3 from participating in leader elections, ensuring that it serves primarily as a voting region without taking on leadership roles.', 'reasoning': \"Alright, I need to help the user update their plan based on the suggestions provided.

Here are the steps and considerations based on the provided information:\\n\\n1. **Adjust Election Timeout Ticks**: \\n   - Use the `raftstore.raft-min-election-timeout-ticks` and `raftstore.raft-max-election-timeout-ticks` settings in the TiKV configuration for nodes in Region 3. By setting these values to higher numbers, you increase the time before these nodes can participate in leader elections. This effectively reduces the likelihood of any replica in Region 3 being elected as a leader.\\n   - Example configuration:\\n     ```yaml\\n     tikv_servers:\\n       - host: <region3-node-host>\\n         config:\\n           raftstore.raft-min-election-timeout-ticks: 50\\n           raftstore.raft-max-election-timeout-ticks: 60\\n     ```\\n\\n2. **Label Configuration**:\\n   - Use PD's label configuration to influence leader election. You can set a label property to reject leaders in Region 3. This is done by configuring the PD to avoid electing leaders in specific regions.\\n   - Example command:\\n     ```shell\\n     tiup ctl:v6.4.0 pd config set label-property reject-leader Region Region3\\n     ```\\n\\n3. **Priority Settings**:\\n   - Adjust the priority of PD members to ensure that nodes in Region 3 have a lower chance of becoming leaders. This can be done by setting a lower priority for PD nodes in Region 3.\\n   - Example command:\\n     ```shell\\n     tiup ctl:v6.4.0 pd member leader_priority <pd-member-name> <priority-value>\\n     ```\\n\\n4. **Testing and Performance Considerations**:\\n   - **Performance Impact**: Increasing the election timeout ticks can lead to slower leader election processes, which might affect the cluster's responsiveness in scenarios where a leader needs to be re-elected quickly.\\n   - **Testing**: It is crucial to test these configurations in a non-production environment first. This allows you to observe the behavior of the cluster under different failure scenarios and ensure that the settings do not negatively impact the overall performance or availability of the cluster.\\n   - **Disaster Recovery**: Consider the implications of these settings in disaster recovery scenarios. If Region 3 is the only region available, the increased election timeout might delay recovery.\\n\\nBy carefully configuring these settings, you can effectively manage the participation of Region 3 in leader elections, aligning with your operational and disaster recovery strategies.\\n\\nVerification Results:\\nTo verify if the proposed configuration parameters are applicable and supported for Region 3, we need to consider the information provided in the documents related to TiDB versions v6.1, v6.5, v7.1, and v7.5. Here is a detailed explanation based on the available data:\\n\\n### Region Size Configuration\\n\\n1. **Region Size Range**: \\n   - The recommended range for the Region size is between 48 MiB and 256 MiB. Commonly used sizes include 96 MiB, 128 MiB, and 256 MiB.\\n   - It is not recommended to set the Region size beyond 1 GiB, and it should definitely not exceed 10 GiB due to potential performance issues such as performance jitters, decreased query performance, and slower Region scheduling.\\n\\n2. **Configuration Parameter**:\\n   - The `coprocessor.region-split-size` configuration item is used to adjust the Region size. This parameter is applicable across the mentioned TiDB versions.\\n\\n3. **Considerations for Tools**:\\n   - When using TiFlash or the Dumpling tool, the Region size should not exceed 1 GiB. If the Region size is increased, the concurrency should be reduced when using the Dumpling tool to prevent TiDB from running out of memory.\\n\\n### Concurrency and Buckets\\n\\n1. **Bucket Configuration**:\\n   - To improve query concurrency after setting Regions to a larger size, the `coprocessor.enable-region-bucket` can be set to `true`. This divides Regions into smaller buckets, which are used as units of concurrent query to improve scan concurrency.\\n   - The bucket size can be controlled using the `coprocessor.region-bucket-size` parameter, with a default value of 96 MiB.\\n\\n2. **Experimental Feature**:\\n   - The bucket feature is experimental and was introduced in TiDB v6.1.0. It is not recommended for use in production environments.\\n\\n### Deployment Configuration\\n\\n1. **Three Availability Zones in Two Regions**:\\n   - The configuration for deploying across three availability zones in two regions involves setting labels for availability and disaster recovery. Labels such as `az`, `replication zone`, `rack`, and `host` are used to define the physical structure of the deployment.\\n   - The `replication.location-labels` parameter in the PD configuration is used to add level information of TiKV labels.\\n\\n2. **Network Optimization**:\\n   - Enabling gRPC message compression in TiKV can lower network traffic.\\n   - For TiKV nodes in another region, parameters like `raftstore.raft-min-election-timeout-ticks` and `raftstore.raft-max-election-timeout-ticks` can be adjusted to prevent replicas from participating in Raft elections, optimizing network configuration.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nFor Region 3, the proposed configuration parameters are generally applicable and supported across the TiDB versions mentioned. However, care should be taken with the Region size and concurrency settings, especially when using tools like TiFlash and Dumpling. Additionally, the bucket feature should be used cautiously as it is experimental. Ensure that deployment configurations are optimized for network performance and disaster recovery.

Adjust Leader Election Timeout\\n\\n- **Objective**: Increase the election timeout for TiKV nodes in Region 3 to delay their participation in leader elections.\\n\\n- **Configuration**:\\n  Modify the `raftstore.raft-min-election-timeout-ticks` and `raftstore.raft-max-election-timeout-ticks` settings in the `tiup topology.yaml` file for TiKV nodes in Region 3.\\n\\n  ```toml\\n  tikv_servers:\\n    - host: tidb-dr-test5\\n      config:\\n        server.labels: { Region: \"Region3\", AZ: \"AZ5\" }\\n        raftstore.raft-min-election-timeout-ticks: 50\\n        raftstore.raft-max-election-timeout-ticks: 60\\n  ```\\n\\n- **References**:\\n  - [TiDB Documentation on Raftstore Configuration](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/tikv-configuration-file#raftstore)\\n\\n#### 2. Reject Leader in Region 3\\n\\n- **Objective**: Prevent Region 3 from becoming a leader by using the `label-property` feature.\\n\\n- **Command**:\\n  Execute the following command to set the label property:\\n\\n  ```shell\\n  tiup ctl:v6.4.0 pd config set label-property reject-leader Region Region3\\n  ```\\n\\n- **References**:\\n  - [TiDB Documentation on Label Properties](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/pd-configuration-file#label-property)\\n\\n#### 3. Implement Placement Rules\\n\\n- **Objective**: Ensure primary replicas are located in other regions, such as Region 1 or Region 2.\\n\\n- **SQL Commands**:\\n  Create and apply placement policies:\\n\\n  ```sql\\n  CREATE PLACEMENT POLICY primary_rule_for_region1 PRIMARY_REGION=\"Region1\" REGIONS=\"Region1, Region2, Region3\";\\n  ALTER TABLE tpcc.warehouse PLACEMENT POLICY=primary_rule_for_region1;\\n  ```\\n\\n- **References**:\\n  - [TiDB Documentation on Placement Rules](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/placement-rules)\\n\\n### Monitoring Strategies\\n\\n- **Monitor Leader Distribution**:\\n  Regularly check the distribution of leaders across regions using the following SQL query:\\n\\n  ```sql\\n  SELECT STORE_ID, address, leader_count, label FROM TIKV_STORE_STATUS ORDER BY store_id;\\n  ```\\n\\n- **Performance Metrics**:\\n  Use monitoring tools like Grafana to track metrics such as latency, throughput, and resource utilization.\\n\\n### Safety Considerations\\n\\n- **Testing in Non-Production Environment**:\\n  Before applying these configurations in a production environment, test them in a non-production setup to observe the effects and make necessary adjustments.\\n\\n- **Backup and Recovery**:\\n  Ensure a robust backup and recovery plan is in place to mitigate potential issues.\\n\\n- **Gradual Rollout**:\\n  Consider rolling out the changes gradually and monitor the impact closely to ensure stability.\\n\\n- **Rollback Procedures**:\\n  Prepare rollback procedures to revert changes if unexpected issues arise. This includes reverting configuration changes and removing label properties or placement rules.\\n\\n### Known Limitations and Considerations\\n\\n- **Disaster Scenarios**:\\n  Be aware that in cases where some TiKV nodes go offline, only regions on nodes with large election timeout ticks might become leaders, potentially delaying leader election.\\n\\n- **Network Latency**:\\n  Adjusting election timeouts can help optimize for network latency but requires careful tuning to balance availability and performance.\\n\\n- **Complexity**:\\n  Managing these settings adds complexity and requires a good understanding of the infrastructure and network conditions.\\n\\nBy following this configuration plan, you can effectively manage leader elections in a TiDB cluster, ensuring that Region 3\\'s participation is delayed or prevented while maintaining cluster performance and safety.', 'reasoning': \"Alright, I need to update the plan based on the user's suggestions. The goal is to prevent Region 3 from becoming a leader in TiDB by adjusting election configurations. The current plan is focused on gathering information and analyzing it, but it lacks some crucial steps that the user suggested.\\n\\nFirst, the user wants to verify if region-specific election timeout settings are supported in the current TiDB version. This is important because if the settings aren't supported, the whole approach might not work. So, I should add a step to retrieve release notes or compatibility guides to check this.\\n\\nNext, the user mentioned including detailed performance impact analysis and monitoring strategies. This means I need to modify the existing LLM analysis step to cover these aspects. I'll update the prompt to include potential performance impacts and suggest monitoring methods.\\n\\nSafety considerations are another key point. The user wants rollback procedures and testing in a non-production environment. I should enhance the safety section in the final configuration plan to outline these steps clearly.\\n\\nLooking at the current plan, after step 2, the next step is to analyze the configuration. I'll need to insert a new step before this analysis to verify the version support. This ensures that the solution is feasible before proceeding.\\n\\nI also need to adjust the final answer to include all these new considerations. The final plan should be comprehensive, addressing version compatibility, performance, and safety.\\n\\nI'll structure the updated plan by first keeping the initial steps unchanged, then adding the verification step, followed by modifying the analysis to include the new considerations. Finally, I'll ensure the final answer reflects all these changes.\\n\\nI have to make sure that each modification directly contributes to achieving the goal without deviating. Also, I need to avoid referencing variables that have been garbage collected and ensure the plan is efficient and adaptable.\\n\\nAfter considering all these points, I'll draft the updated plan, ensuring it's well-structured and meets all the user's suggestions.\", 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': \"To prevent Region 3 from participating in leader elections, we need to explore TiDB's election mechanisms and configuration options.

The goal is to understand the discrepancy in key formats.\\n\\nFirst, I'll consider the possible reasons for this difference. It could be related to how TiDB encodes keys for different types of data or regions. Maybe 'r_' stands for a row key, while 'i_' stands for an index or internal key. TiDB's key encoding might use different prefixes to denote different types of keys, which could explain the varying formats.\\n\\nNext, I need to gather more information about TiDB's key encoding and region distribution. I'll use the `retrieve_knowledge_graph` tool to get structured data on how TiDB handles keys in clustered primary key tables. This should provide insights into the encoding mechanisms and any associated prefixes.\\n\\nAdditionally, I'll use `vector_search` to find relevant documentation or discussions that explain the use of 'r_' and 'i_' prefixes. This will help me understand what each prefix signifies and how they relate to the key formats observed in the regions.\\n\\nOnce I have this information, I'll use `llm_generate` to synthesize the findings. The prompt will instruct the tool to explain the discrepancy, focusing on the key prefixes and their implications. I'll make sure the generated explanation is in English and addresses both the integer ID regions and the others.\\n\\nTo ensure thoroughness, I'll add a verification step using `vector_search` again, this time to cross-check the findings against TiDB's official documentation. This will help confirm whether the explanation aligns with TiDB's key management practices.\\n\\nFinally, I'll compile all the information into a coherent explanation, ensuring it's clear and directly addresses the user's query.

A Region is a contiguous range of key-value pairs, and it serves as a logical division of data, similar to a shard or partition in other databases. Regions are distributed among multiple TiKV instances to facilitate data distribution, fault tolerance, and high availability.\\n\\nWhen dealing with tables that have a clustered primary key, the way data is stored and accessed can lead to variations in the key formats across different Regions. Here are some reasons why integer IDs might not be used for some Regions and why there might be discrepancies in key formats:\\n\\n1. **Clustered Primary Key Encoding**: In a clustered primary key table, the data is physically stored in the same order as the primary key index. This means that the primary key itself is used as the row identifier, which can be a composite key consisting of multiple columns. As a result, the keys in the Regions might not be simple integer IDs but rather composite keys that include multiple column values.\\n\\n2. **Key Encoding Variations**: The encoding of keys in TiDB involves using `table_id`, `index_id`, and `index_value`. For tables with clustered primary keys, the `index_value` part of the key can be complex, especially if the primary key is a composite key. This complexity can lead to variations in the key formats across different Regions.\\n\\n3. **Region Splitting and Merging**: TiDB automatically manages the size of Regions to ensure balanced distribution across the cluster. When a Region grows too large, it is split into smaller Regions. Conversely, small Regions can be merged. During these operations, the keys at the boundaries of Regions might not align perfectly with integer IDs, leading to discrepancies in key formats.\\n\\n4. **Data Distribution and Hotspot Avoidance**: TiDB aims to distribute data evenly across the cluster to avoid hotspots. This distribution can result in Regions having different key formats, especially if the data distribution is influenced by the primary key's structure.\\n\\n5. **Follower Read and Key Formats**: With features like Follower Read, TiDB allows read requests to be handled by follower nodes in addition to the leader node of a Region. This can further influence how keys are managed and distributed across Regions.\\n\\nIn summary, the use of clustered primary keys and the need for efficient data distribution and management in TiDB lead to variations in key formats across different Regions. These variations are a result of the complex encoding of composite keys, automatic Region management, and the goal of avoiding data hotspots.\", 'reasoning': \"The goal is to understand why integer IDs are not used for some regions in a clustered primary key table in TiDB, and why there is a discrepancy in key formats across different regions.

Here's an explanation of why integer IDs might not be used for some regions and why there might be discrepancies in key formats across different regions:\\n\\n1. **Clustered Primary Key Structure**: In TiDB, a clustered primary key means that the table data is physically stored in the same order as the primary key index. This can involve composite keys, which consist of multiple columns, rather than a single integer column. When a composite key is used, the key format for regions will include all the columns that make up the primary key, leading to more complex key structures compared to a simple integer key.\\n\\n2. **Region Splitting**: TiDB automatically splits regions when they exceed a certain size (96 MiB by default). This splitting is based on the key range, which means that the keys at the boundaries of regions can vary depending on the data distribution and the primary key structure. For tables with composite clustered primary keys, the split keys will reflect the composite nature of the primary key, resulting in non-integer key formats.\\n\\n3. **Region Merging**: Conversely, regions that become too small (below a certain threshold) can be merged. This merging process can also affect the key formats, as the merged region will encompass a broader range of keys, potentially combining different key structures from the original regions.\\n\\n4. **Composite vs. Integer Key Structures**: When a table uses a composite primary key, the keys used for region boundaries will include all components of the composite key. This contrasts with tables that use a single integer primary key, where the region keys are straightforward integer values. The presence of composite keys leads to more complex key formats, as seen in the `START_KEY` and `END_KEY` values in region information.\\n\\n5. **Key Encoding**: TiDB encodes keys using a combination of table ID, index ID, and the actual key values. For composite keys, this encoding includes all parts of the key, which can result in longer and more complex key formats compared to simple integer keys.\\n\\nThese factors contribute to the differences in key formats across regions in a clustered primary key table.

This discrepancy arises from several factors, including region splitting, merging, and the inherent differences between integer and composite key structures.\\n\\n1. **Region Splitting and Merging**: TiDB uses regions as the basic unit of data distribution and management. Each region typically holds a contiguous range of key-value pairs. When a region grows beyond a certain size (96 MiB by default), it is split into smaller regions to maintain performance and balance the load across the cluster. Conversely, smaller regions may be merged to optimize resource usage. This dynamic splitting and merging can result in regions with varying key formats, especially when the data distribution is uneven or when there are changes in the data access patterns.\\n\\n2. **Integer vs. Composite Key Structures**: In tables with integer primary keys, the primary key itself is used as the row ID, which simplifies the key structure. This allows for straightforward region splitting based on integer ranges. However, in tables with composite primary keys, the key structure is more complex, as it involves multiple columns. The encoding of these composite keys includes all the columns that make up the primary key, leading to a more intricate key format. This complexity can result in regions with non-integer keys, as the composite key values are used to determine the boundaries of each region.\\n\\n3. **Key Encoding and Decoding**: TiDB encodes keys using a combination of table ID, index ID, and the actual key values. For composite keys, this encoding includes all the components of the primary key, which can lead to longer and more complex key formats. The `TIDB_DECODE_KEY` function can be used to decode these keys, revealing the underlying structure and values.\\n\\n4. **Discrepancies in Key Formats**: The differences in key formats across regions are primarily due to the nature of the primary key and the operations performed on the table. For instance, regions in a table with a composite primary key will have keys that reflect the composite structure, while regions in a table with an integer primary key will have simpler, integer-based keys. Additionally, operations such as region splitting and merging can further contribute to variations in key formats, as they adjust the boundaries and distribution of data within the cluster.\\n\\nIn summary, the use of clustered primary keys in TiDB, combined with the dynamic nature of region management and the differences between integer and composite key structures, leads to variations in key formats across regions. These differences are a natural consequence of TiDB's design, which aims to optimize data distribution and access efficiency in a distributed database environment.\", 'reasoning': \"Alright, so I need to figure out why there are discrepancies in the key formats across different regions in a TiDB table with a clustered primary key.

Specifically, the prefixes 'r' and 'i' in the keys denote different types of data storage.\\n\\n1. **Key Encoding**: In TiDB, the keys for row data and index data are encoded differently. For row data, the format is `t[table_id]_r[row_id]`, where 'r' indicates a row key. For index data, the format is `t[table_id]_i[index_id][index_value]`, where 'i' indicates an index key. This distinction helps TiDB efficiently manage and access data stored in different regions.\\n\\n2. **Clustered Primary Key**: A clustered primary key means that the table data is physically stored in the same order as the primary key index. This can lead to different key formats depending on whether the primary key is an integer or a composite key. If the primary key is a single integer, the row key format is straightforward, using the 'r' prefix. However, if the primary key is composite or non-integer, the key format might not use integer IDs, and the encoding will reflect the composite nature of the key.\\n\\n3. **Region Distribution and Index Region Splitting**: TiDB distributes data across different regions to optimize performance. The distribution is based on the encoded keys, and regions can be split based on index values. This process uses the key encoding scheme to determine split points, which can result in different key formats across regions.\\n\\n4. **Limitations and Compatibility**: There are certain limitations when using clustered indexes, such as the inability to use `SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS` or `PRE_SPLIT_REGIONS` with clustered indexes. Additionally, compatibility issues may arise when upgrading or downgrading TiDB versions, as the clustered index feature has evolved over different versions.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on clustered indexes and their limitations, you can refer to the TiDB documentation [here](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/clustered-indexes).\", 'reasoning': \"Alright, I'm trying to figure out why some regions in a TiDB table have integer IDs while others don't.

Here is a detailed breakdown based on the official TiDB documentation:\\n\\n1. **Key Prefixes**:\\n   - **'r' Prefix**: This prefix is used for row data keys. In TiDB, the key of row data in each table is encoded using the format `t[table_id]_r[row_id]`. This format is typically used when the primary key is an integer, which is common in tables with clustered indexes.\\n   - **'i' Prefix**: This prefix is used for index data keys. The format for index keys is `t[table_id]_i[index_id][index_value]`, where `index_id` identifies the index, and `index_value` is the value of the indexed column. This format is used when the primary key is not a simple integer, such as in composite or non-integer primary keys.\\n\\n2. **Clustered vs. Non-Clustered Indexes**:\\n   - **Clustered Indexes**: In tables with clustered indexes, the primary key data given by the user is used directly as the key for row data. This means only one key-value pair is needed to store a row: the primary key data (key) and the row data (value).\\n   - **Non-Clustered Indexes**: In tables with non-clustered indexes, an internal `_tidb_rowid` is used. This requires at least two key-value pairs to store a row: `_tidb_rowid` (key) with row data (value), and primary key data (key) with `_tidb_rowid` (value).\\n\\n3. **Compatibility and Limitations**:\\n   - TiDB does not support downgrading tables with clustered indexes. If a downgrade is necessary, logical backup tools must be used to migrate data.\\n   - The clustered index feature is not compatible with certain attributes like `SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS` and `PRE_SPLIT_REGIONS`.\\n   - When using TiDB Binlog, only a single integer column can be used as the clustered index of a primary key. Non-integer primary keys are not supported in this scenario.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the official TiDB documentation on clustered indexes and region splitting:\\n- [Clustered Indexes in TiDB](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/clustered-indexes)\\n- [SQL Statement: Split Region](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/sql-statement-split-region)\\n\\nThese resources provide comprehensive insights into how TiDB handles clustered indexes and the implications for key formats and data storage.\", 'reasoning': \"Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to update the plan based on the user's suggestions. The goal is to explain why some regions in TiDB have integer IDs while others don't. The current plan is already set up, but the suggestions mention improving it by integrating verification results and addressing edge cases.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the current plan. It starts by using `retrieve_knowledge_graph` to get structured data on TiDB's key encoding. Then, it uses `vector_search` twice: once for general key encoding info and once for the specific prefixes 'r' and 'i'. After that, it generates an explanation using `llm_generate`, followed by another `vector_search` for verification and a final verification step.\\n\\nThe suggestions say that the plan could be better by explicitly integrating the verification results into the final answer.

This mechanism impacts both write performance and latency, especially when comparing clusters with different numbers of replicas.\\n\\n### Impact of Replication on Write Performance and Latency\\n\\n1. **Write Performance:**\\n   - **3 Replicas:** In a TiDB cluster with 3 replicas, a write is considered successful once it is written to 2 out of the 3 replicas. This setup generally offers better write performance because fewer replicas need to be written to achieve consensus. The system can tolerate the loss of one replica while still maintaining data consistency.\\n   - **5 Replicas:** In a cluster with 5 replicas, a write must be committed to at least 3 replicas to be considered successful. This increases the write overhead as more replicas need to be updated, potentially reducing the overall write throughput compared to a 3-replica setup.\\n\\n2. **Latency:**\\n   - **3 Replicas:** The write latency in a 3-replica setup is typically lower because the system only needs to wait for the two fastest replicas to acknowledge the write. This can be particularly advantageous in scenarios where low latency is critical.\\n   - **5 Replicas:** With 5 replicas, the write latency may increase as the system waits for acknowledgments from a majority of the replicas (3 out of 5). This can introduce additional delay, especially if the network conditions or the performance of some replicas are suboptimal.\\n\\n### Performance Comparison\\n\\n- **3 Replicas:**\\n  - Generally provides better write performance and lower latency due to the reduced number of replicas required for consensus.\\n  - Suitable for environments where write performance and low latency are prioritized over higher fault tolerance.\\n\\n- **5 Replicas:**\\n  - Offers higher fault tolerance, as the system can withstand the loss of up to two replicas without losing data consistency.\\n  - May experience reduced write performance and increased latency due to the need to write to more replicas.\\n\\n### Practical Considerations\\n\\n- **Network Conditions:** The impact of replication on performance is also influenced by network conditions. In geo-distributed setups, the latency between data centers can significantly affect write performance, especially with more replicas.\\n- **Data Center Deployment:** For deployments across multiple data centers, the choice between 3 and 5 replicas should consider the trade-off between fault tolerance and performance. A 3-replica setup might be more efficient in a single data center or closely located data centers, while 5 replicas might be preferred for higher resilience in distributed environments.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the choice between 3 and 5 replicas in a TiDB cluster should be guided by the specific requirements for write performance, latency, and fault tolerance.

This is because the Raft algorithm needs to achieve consensus among a larger number of nodes, which can increase the time taken to confirm writes, especially in environments with high data volume or significant latency between data centers.\\n  - The write throughput may also be lower in a 5-replica setup due to the increased overhead of maintaining consensus across more nodes. This can be particularly noticeable in geo-distributed environments where network latency is a factor.\\n\\n- **3 Replicas**:\\n  - A 3-replica setup tends to offer better write performance, with lower latency and higher throughput.

This setup allows for faster consensus and reduced write latency, making it suitable for applications that require quick data processing and lower latency.\\n  \\n- **Data Integrity and Fault Tolerance**: While a 5-replica setup may introduce higher latency, it offers greater fault tolerance and data integrity. With more replicas, the system can withstand a higher number of node failures without compromising data availability, which is crucial for applications that prioritize data durability over performance.\\n\\n- **Configuration and Software Versions**: The performance differences are also influenced by the specific software versions and configurations used in the tests. For instance, TiDB version 5.4.0 showed improvements over 5.3.0 in a 5-replica setup, while version 3.0 outperformed 2.1 in a 3-replica setup, highlighting the importance of software optimizations and configuration tuning in achieving optimal performance.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nIn summary, the choice between 5 replicas and 3 replicas in a TiDB cluster involves a trade-off between performance and fault tolerance.

One of the critical decisions when configuring a TiDB cluster is determining the number of replicas. This report compares TiDB clusters with 5 replicas to those with 3 replicas, focusing on write operations, performance metrics, and the effects of replication. The analysis highlights key differences and trade-offs between these configurations.\\n\\n## Write Throughput\\n\\n### 3-Replica Cluster\\n- **Higher Write Throughput**: A TiDB cluster with 3 replicas generally achieves higher write throughput. This is because the system needs to write and acknowledge data across fewer nodes, reducing the write overhead. The reduced number of replicas means that the data replication process is less resource-intensive, allowing for faster write operations.\\n\\n### 5-Replica Cluster\\n- **Lower Write Throughput**: In contrast, a 5-replica setup involves more nodes in the replication process, which increases the amount of data that needs to be written and acknowledged. This additional overhead can lead to a decrease in write throughput compared to a 3-replica configuration.\\n\\n## Latency\\n\\n### 3-Replica Cluster\\n- **Lower Latency**: The latency in a 3-replica cluster is typically lower. With fewer nodes involved in achieving consensus and committing transactions, the time required for these operations is reduced. This results in faster response times for write operations.\\n\\n### 5-Replica Cluster\\n- **Higher Latency**: A 5-replica setup requires more nodes to agree on a transaction, which can increase the time taken to reach consensus. This additional step can lead to higher latency compared to a 3-replica cluster.\\n\\n## Fault Tolerance\\n\\n### 3-Replica Cluster\\n- **Reduced Fault Tolerance**: While a 3-replica cluster offers better performance, it provides less fault tolerance. The system can only tolerate a limited number of node failures before data availability and durability are compromised.\\n\\n### 5-Replica Cluster\\n- **Enhanced Fault Tolerance**: A 5-replica cluster offers superior fault tolerance. With more replicas, the system can withstand multiple node failures without losing data or availability. This configuration is ideal for applications that require high availability and data durability.\\n\\n## Trade-offs\\n\\nThe choice between a 3-replica and a 5-replica TiDB cluster involves balancing performance and fault tolerance:\\n\\n- **3-Replica Setup**: This configuration is more performance-oriented, offering higher write throughput and lower latency. However, it sacrifices some level of fault tolerance, making it suitable for environments where performance is prioritized over resilience.\\n\\n- **5-Replica Setup**: This setup prioritizes fault tolerance and data durability, making it more resilient to node failures. The trade-off is a reduction in write throughput and an increase in latency, which may impact performance-sensitive applications.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nChoosing between a 3-replica and a 5-replica TiDB cluster depends on the specific requirements of the application. A 3-replica cluster is ideal for scenarios where performance is critical, while a 5-replica cluster is better suited for applications that demand high availability and fault tolerance. Understanding these trade-offs is essential for optimizing the performance and reliability of TiDB deployments.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on TiDB's replication and performance characteristics, you can refer to the following sources:\\n- [TiDB Best Practices](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.3/tidb-best-practices)\\n- [TiDB Scheduler](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/v1.6/tidb-scheduler)\\n- [DR Solution Based on Multiple Replicas in a Single Cluster](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/dr-multi-replica)\", 'reasoning': 'Okay, so I\\'m trying to help update the plan based on the suggestions provided. Let me go through this step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the current plan and what it\\'s trying to achieve. The goal is to write a performance comparison between TiDB clusters with 5 replicas and 3 replicas, focusing on write operations. The original plan uses vector_search to gather information on replication impact and performance benchmarks for both replica configurations, then uses llm_generate to synthesize the findings into a report.\\n\\nNow, looking at the suggestions, there are three main points:\\n\\n1. Incorporate retrieve_knowledge_graph alongside vector_search to gather a broader range of detailed information.\\n2. Add an intermediate step to summarize and explicitly compare the retrieved data.\\n3. Modify the llm_generate step to use the summarized context, ensuring the final answer highlights comparative insights.\\n\\nI need to assess how these suggestions align with the current plan and the goal. The suggestions aim to improve the quality and depth of the final answer by broadening the data sources and enhancing the analysis.\\n\\nStarting with the first suggestion: adding retrieve_knowledge_graph. This tool can provide structured knowledge from a knowledge graph, which complements the document snippets from vector_search. By using both, we can gather more comprehensive data, including relationships and entities relevant to TiDB replication.\\n\\nThe second suggestion is about adding a summarization step. This makes sense because the data from vector_search and retrieve_knowledge_graph might be fragmented. A summarization step can consolidate the findings, making the comparison clearer and more focused on the key metrics like write throughput and latency.\\n\\nThe third suggestion modifies the llm_generate step to use the summarized context. This ensures that the final report is well-structured and highlights the necessary comparative insights, making it more valuable to the user.\\n\\nNow, considering the current execution state, the plan has already executed step 0 (vector_search for replication impact). The next steps are to incorporate the suggestions starting from the current program counter, which is 1.\\n\\nI need to modify the plan by adding retrieve_knowledge_graph calls for both replication impact and performance benchmarks. Then, include a summarization step that consolidates and compares the retrieved data. This summary will be used in the final llm_generate step to produce a comprehensive report.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that each step is properly sequenced and that variables are correctly referenced. Since the plan has already executed step 0, I\\'ll start adding new steps from seq_no 1 onwards, ensuring that all previous steps remain unchanged.\\n\\nPotential challenges include ensuring that the summarization step effectively combines data from both vector_search and retrieve_knowledge_graph without redundancy. Also, the llm_generate step must be tailored to use the summarized context effectively.\\n\\nTo address these, I\\'ll structure the new steps to first gather additional knowledge using retrieve_knowledge_graph, then summarize the combined data, and finally generate the report based on this summary. This approach should provide a more thorough and insightful comparison.\\n\\nIn terms of efficiency, adding these steps might increase the plan\\'s execution time, but the enhanced quality of the final report should justify this. Additionally, by processing the data through summarization, we can avoid overwhelming the llm_generate step with too much raw information.\\n\\nI also need to make sure that all output variables are correctly assigned and referenced. For example, after retrieving knowledge, the variables should be passed into the summarization step, which then feeds into the final report generation.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll ensure that the plan adheres to the VM specifications, using only the allowed tools and maintaining the correct structure.

This report provides a detailed comparison of TiDB clusters configured with 5 replicas versus those with 3 replicas, focusing on write operations, including throughput, latency, and resource utilization. The trade-offs between these replication levels and their impact on performance are also discussed.\\n\\n## Write Throughput\\n\\n### 3-Replica Clusters\\nClusters with 3 replicas generally achieve higher write throughput compared to those with 5 replicas. This is because the system requires fewer acknowledgments to commit a write operation. In a 3-replica setup, a majority of 2 replicas must acknowledge the write, allowing for quicker consensus and higher throughput.\\n\\n### 5-Replica Clusters\\nIn contrast, 5-replica clusters exhibit lower write throughput. The need to maintain more copies of the data increases the overhead for write operations. A majority of 3 replicas must acknowledge each write, which can slow down the process and reduce throughput.\\n\\n## Latency\\n\\n### 3-Replica Clusters\\nThe latency for write operations in a 3-replica setup is typically lower. With fewer nodes required to reach consensus, the time taken to commit a write is reduced, resulting in faster write operations.\\n\\n### 5-Replica Clusters\\nClusters with 5 replicas experience higher latency in write operations. The Raft consensus algorithm, used by TiDB, requires a majority of nodes to agree on a write before it is committed. With more replicas, the time to reach consensus increases, especially if the replicas are distributed across multiple regions or data centers.\\n\\n## Resource Utilization\\n\\n### 3-Replica Clusters\\nA 3-replica setup is more resource-efficient. It requires less storage space and generates less network traffic, as fewer replicas need to be synchronized. This can lead to lower operational costs and reduced demand on infrastructure.\\n\\n### 5-Replica Clusters\\nA 5-replica configuration demands more resources. Each additional replica requires storage space and increases network traffic to keep the replicas synchronized. This setup can lead to higher operational costs and necessitates more robust infrastructure to maintain performance levels.\\n\\n## Trade-offs\\n\\nThe primary trade-off between using 5 replicas versus 3 is between data redundancy and performance:\\n\\n- **5-Replica Clusters**: Offer higher fault tolerance and data availability. The system can tolerate more node failures without losing data, making it suitable for applications where data availability is critical. However, this comes at the cost of increased latency and reduced throughput.\\n\\n- **3-Replica Clusters**: Provide better performance with lower latency and higher throughput. This setup is ideal for applications where performance is prioritized over redundancy. However, it offers less fault tolerance, as fewer node failures can be tolerated without risking data loss.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nChoosing between 3 and 5 replicas involves balancing the need for high availability and fault tolerance against the desire for lower latency and higher throughput. Organizations must consider their specific requirements and constraints, such as the criticality of data availability and the capacity of their infrastructure, when deciding on the replication level for their TiDB clusters.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on TiDB replication and performance, you can refer to the following sources:\\n- [TiDB Best Practices](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.3/tidb-best-practices)\\n- [DR Solution Based on Multiple Replicas in a Single Cluster](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/dr-multi-replica)', 'reasoning': 'Alright, so I need to update the plan based on the suggestions provided.

TiDB has undergone several changes in its collation framework over different versions, which affects the availability and behavior of certain collations.\\n\\n1. **Collation Framework**: TiDB introduced a new collation framework starting from version 4.0, which semantically parses different collations and strictly follows them for string comparisons. This framework supports a specific set of collations, and the availability of collations like `utf8mb4_general_ci` depends on whether the new framework is enabled and the specific version of TiDB.\\n\\n2. **Version-Specific Support**: The support for `utf8mb4_general_ci` and other collations can vary between different versions of TiDB. In some versions, certain collations might not be listed due to the ongoing development and enhancement of the collation framework. This can result in some collations being temporarily unavailable or not displayed in the `SHOW COLLATION` output.\\n\\n3. **Default Collations**: TiDB defaults to using binary collations (e.g., `utf8mb4_bin`), which are case-sensitive, unlike MySQL, which typically uses case-insensitive collations by default. This difference in default behavior can also influence the visibility and usage of certain collations in TiDB.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on the character sets and collations supported by TiDB, you can refer to the official documentation: [Character Set and Collation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v5.3/character-set-and-collation).\\n\\n此答案基于知识图谱和文档片段分析，结合了TiDB 5.3.4版本的排序规则特性。', 'reasoning': '好，我现在需要分析用户的问题，并根据提供的信息更新计划。用户的问题是，为什么在TiDB 5.3.4版本中，执行`SHOW COLLATION`命令时没有显示`utf8mb4_general_ci`。用户还提供了背景信息，指出这可能与TiDB对排序规则的支持以及版本特性有关。\\n\\n首先，我需要理解当前的执行计划。当前计划包括三个步骤：使用`retrieve_knowledge_graph`获取结构化数据，使用`vector_search`查找相关的文档片段，最后使用`llm_generate`生成最终答案。这三步都是为了分析问题并提供解释。\\n\\n接下来，我需要考虑用户的建议。用户建议在最终答案中确保使用中文，并增加关于TiDB新版排序规则框架与旧版差异的说明，以及TiDB默认使用`utf8mb4_bin`的原因。此外，用户建议添加一个语言和格式检查步骤，以确保答案符合要求，并优化`llm_generate`阶段，引用官方文档中对新旧框架的解释，使答案更全面准确。\\n\\n现在，我需要评估这些建议如何与当前计划相符合。当前计划已经涵盖了信息检索和生成，但缺乏对TiDB版本特性的深入分析，以及对默认排序规则的解释。因此，我需要在计划中添加步骤，以处理这些方面。\\n\\n首先，我会在`llm_generate`阶段增加一个参数，明确要求引用官方文档中关于新旧排序规则框架的解释。这可以通过修改`prompt`来实现，指示LLM在生成答案时引用相关文档。\\n\\n其次，用户建议增加一个语言和格式检查步骤。为了实现这一点，可以在计划中添加一个`assign`指令，检查生成的答案是否符合中文要求，并在必要时进行调整。这可以通过模板字符串和变量引用来完成，确保最终答案的语言一致性。\\n\\n最后，我需要确保所有步骤保持不变，直到当前程序计数器（Program Counter）的位置。当前程序计数器在步骤3，所以之前的步骤0到2保持不变。\\n\\n总结一下，我需要在当前计划的基础上，修改步骤2的`llm_generate`参数，增加对官方文档的引用，并添加一个新的`assign`步骤，用于语言和格式检查。这将确保生成的答案更全面、准确，并符合用户的语言要求。\\n\\n现在，我需要将这些修改整合到现有的计划中，确保每个步骤都是有效的，并且符合VM的规范。特别是要确保变量引用正确，避免使用已经垃圾回收的变量，并且所有步骤的`seq_no`是连续递增的。\\n\\n最后，我会生成一个更新后的计划，包括所有必要的修改，以确保能够满足用户的需求，并提供一个详尽、准确的答案。', 'plan': [{'parameters': {'output_vars': ['collation_knowledge_graph'], 'tool_name': 'retrieve_knowledge_graph', 'tool_params': {'query': 'Collation support in TiDB version 5.3.4'}}, 'seq_no': 0, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['collation_documentation_snippets'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'utf8mb4_general_ci collation support in TiDB 5.3.4', 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 1, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['final_answer'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': '${collation_knowledge_graph}\\n${collation_documentation_snippets}', 'prompt': '请分析TiDB 5.3.4版本中未显示utf8mb4_general_ci排序规则的原因。结合知识图谱结果和文档片段，提供一个详细的解释。请确保生成的文本使用中文，并引用官方文档中对新旧排序规则框架差异的解释。'}}, 'seq_no': 2, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'final_answer': '最终答案：\\n${final_answer}\\n\\n此答案基于知识图谱和文档片段分析，结合了TiDB 5.3.4版本的排序规则特性。'}, 'seq_no': 3, 'type': 'assign'}]}, {'commit_hash': 'fed6e54a476448c5b13b6f2c42257e6e', 'committed_at': '2025-02-20T17:31:39', 'description': \"Executed seq_no: 2, step: 'calling', tool: llm_generate\", 'seq_no': 2, 'commit_type': 'StepExecution', 'parent_hash': 'df4f767a95c04ec9ae24e531ac016970', 'final_answer': \"The absence of the `utf8mb4_general_ci` collation in the TiDB 5.3.4 version can be attributed to the specific collations supported by TiDB at that time.

This is different from MySQL, which typically uses case-insensitive collations by default. The choice of default collations can affect which collations are visible or available in a given TiDB version.\\n\\n3. **Configuration Settings**: The `new_collations_enabled_on_first_bootstrap` configuration setting determines whether the new collation framework is used when a TiDB cluster is first initialized.

It offers various routing options and configurations to optimize the data import process. Here is a detailed explanation of the available routing options and configurations for TiDB Lightning:\\n\\n### Routing Options and Configurations\\n\\n1. **Schema Routing**:\\n   - Schema routing is a process in TiDB Lightning that deals with mapping schemas during data import. It has been improved to address issues with incorrect routing that previously affected data import processes.\\n\\n2. **Import Modes**:\\n   - **Logical Import Mode**: This mode imports data through SQL statements using the TiDB backend. It is suitable for scenarios where compatibility with log backup and TiCDC is required, although it offers lower performance compared to the Physical Import Mode. This mode provides flexibility in handling data conflicts.\\n   - **Physical Import Mode**: This mode directly ingests encoded KV pairs into TiKV, bypassing the SQL layer. It is designed for high-performance data import, suitable for importing data into empty tables and initializing empty clusters. This mode requires sufficient local storage for external sorting.\\n\\n3. **Configuration Files**:\\n   - TiDB Lightning uses configuration files to control its behavior, including global and task-specific settings. The configuration files are crucial for setting up import tasks, including character set settings and other parameters.\\n\\n4. **Key Configuration Parameters**:\\n   - **`backend`**: Determines the import mode, either \"local\" for Physical Import Mode or \"tidb\" for Logical Import Mode.\\n   - **`data-source-dir`**: Specifies the directory of the data source, which can be a local path or an S3 path.\\n   - **`sorted-kv-dir`**: Sets the temporary storage directory for sorted Key-Value files, which must be empty and have sufficient space.\\n   - **`pause-pd-scheduler-scope`**: Controls the scope of PD scheduling pauses during import, with options like \"table\" or \"global\".\\n\\n5. **Performance and Stability Enhancements**:\\n   - TiDB Lightning includes features like optimized Scatter Region to batch mode, a retry mechanism for restoring schemas, and the calculation of local checksums before sending data to TiKV Importer. These enhancements improve the stability and performance of data imports.\\n\\n6. **Monitoring and Logging**:\\n   - TiDB Lightning supports monitoring through log files and Grafana dashboards. It requires sufficient disk space for sorted KV files, more than 64 GiB of memory, and logical CPU cores for optimal performance.\\n\\n7. **Version-Specific Features**:\\n   - In version v6.4.0, TiDB Lightning modified its behavior to handle files ending with uncompressed formats differently. In version v7.1.0, scheduling control behavior changed, introducing the `pause-pd-scheduler-scope` configuration parameter.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on configuring TiDB Lightning, you can refer to the official documentation [here](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/tidb-lightning-configuration) and [here](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/tidb-lightning-logical-import-mode-usage).', 'reasoning': 'To address the goal of understanding the routing options and configurations available for TiDB Lightning, we need to gather comprehensive information about how TiDB Lightning handles data routing during the import process.

Understanding the configuration and best practices for these modes is crucial for optimizing performance and ensuring data integrity.\\n\\n### Physical Import Mode\\n\\n**Configuration and Parameters:**\\n\\n1. **PD Scheduling Scope**: \\n   - TiDB Lightning allows you to control the scope of pausing PD scheduling during data import. By default, the scheduling is paused only for the Region that stores the target table data (`\"table\"` scope). This minimizes the impact on online applications. However, if there is no business traffic, setting the scope to `\"global\"` can avoid interference from other scheduling activities during the import process. This feature is available from version 7.1.0 onwards [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode-usage).\\n\\n2. **Region Splitting**:\\n   - Parameters such as `region-split-batch-size` and `region-split-concurrency` control how regions are split during import. These settings help manage the number of regions that can be split simultaneously, which is crucial for handling large datasets efficiently. The default batch size is 4096, and the concurrency is typically set to the number of CPU cores [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/tidb-lightning-configuration).\\n\\n3. **Disk Quota**:\\n   - The `disk-quota` parameter specifies the disk space allocated for local temporary files. When the quota is reached, TiDB Lightning prioritizes writing sorted key-value pairs to TiKV, ensuring that the import process continues smoothly without running out of disk space [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.5/tidb-lightning-configuration).\\n\\n**Best Practices:**\\n\\n- **Hardware Requirements**: Ensure that the deployment environment meets the recommended hardware specifications, such as a 32+ logical cores CPU, 20GB+ memory, and a 10 Gigabit network card. This setup helps handle the resource-intensive nature of TiDB Lightning [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v5.4/deploy-tidb-lightning).\\n\\n- **Data Volume Considerations**: For large datasets (greater than 1 TiB), the physical import mode is preferred due to its ability to handle large volumes efficiently. However, during the import, the TiDB cluster cannot provide services, so plan accordingly.\\n\\n### Logical Import Mode\\n\\n**Configuration and Parameters:**\\n\\n1. **SQL Statement Size**:\\n   - The `logical-import-batch-size` parameter controls the size of each SQL statement executed on the downstream TiDB server. This setting helps manage the transaction size and reduce stress on the cluster. The default value is 96KiB, optimized for import speed when TiDB Lightning is the only client [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-lightning-configuration).\\n\\n2. **Transaction Rows**:\\n   - The `logical-import-batch-rows` parameter limits the number of rows inserted per transaction, with a default of 65536 rows. Adjusting this parameter can help manage transaction sizes and reduce the impact on cluster performance [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-lightning-configuration).\\n\\n**Best Practices:**\\n\\n- **Small Data Volumes**: For datasets smaller than 1 TiB, the logical import mode is suitable as it allows the TiDB cluster to remain operational during the import. This mode is also beneficial when data integrity and conflict handling are priorities.\\n\\n- **Performance Tuning**: Adjust parameters like `distsql-scan-concurrency` to reduce the impact of checksum and analyze operations on transaction latency. This tuning is essential for maintaining performance during data import [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode-usage).\\n\\nIn summary, choosing between physical and logical import modes depends on the data volume and the operational requirements of the TiDB cluster. Proper configuration and adherence to best practices ensure efficient data import while minimizing the impact on cluster performance. For more detailed information, you can refer to the official documentation [here](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/tidb-lightning-configuration) and [here](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode-usage).\\n\\nVerification Summary:\\nUpon reviewing the detailed explanation of TiDB Lightning\\'s physical and logical import modes, I have cross-referenced the information with the available sources to verify its accuracy and identify any discrepancies or additional insights.\\n\\n### Verification Summary:\\n\\n1. **Physical Import Mode:**\\n   - **PD Scheduling Scope:** The explanation correctly states that from version 7.1.0 onwards, TiDB Lightning allows control over the PD scheduling scope during data import, with options for `\"table\"` and `\"global\"` scopes. This is confirmed by the source [here](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode-usage).\\n   - **Region Splitting:** The parameters `region-split-batch-size` and `region-split-concurrency` are accurately described, with default values and their impact on handling large datasets. This is consistent with the source [here](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/tidb-lightning-configuration).\\n   - **Disk Quota:** The `disk-quota` parameter\\'s role in managing local temporary files is correctly explained, ensuring the import process continues smoothly. This is supported by the source [here](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.5/tidb-lightning-configuration).\\n\\n2. **Logical Import Mode:**\\n   - **SQL Statement Size and Transaction Rows:** The parameters `logical-import-batch-size` and `logical-import-batch-rows` are accurately described, with their default values and impact on transaction management. This information is verified by the source [here](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-lightning-configuration).\\n\\n3. **Best Practices:**\\n   - The best practices for both import modes, including hardware requirements and data volume considerations, are well-aligned with the official recommendations. The emphasis on performance tuning, such as adjusting `distsql-scan-concurrency`, is also correctly highlighted.\\n\\n### Additional Insights:\\n- The explanation provides a comprehensive overview of the configuration and best practices for both import modes, ensuring efficient data import while minimizing the impact on cluster performance.\\n- It is important to regularly check the official documentation for any updates or changes in configuration parameters and best practices, as TiDB Lightning continues to evolve.\\n\\nFor further details, you can refer to the official documentation linked in the sources provided.', 'reasoning': \"Okay, so I need to update the plan based on the user's suggestions.

Understanding the configuration and best practices for these modes is crucial for optimizing performance and ensuring data integrity.\\n\\n### Configuration and Parameters\\n\\n**1. Physical Import Mode:**\\n\\n- **PD Scheduling Scope:** In physical import mode, TiDB Lightning can control the scope of pausing PD scheduling using the `pause-pd-scheduler-scope` parameter. The default value is `\"table\"`, which pauses scheduling only for the Region storing the target table data. This minimizes the impact on online applications. For clusters without business traffic, setting this parameter to `\"global\"` can avoid interference from other scheduling activities during import. This feature is available from version 7.1.0 onwards. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode-usage).\\n\\n- **Region Splitting:** Parameters like `region-split-batch-size` and `region-split-concurrency` control how regions are split during import. These settings help manage the number of regions that can be split simultaneously, optimizing the import process. The default batch size is 4096, and concurrency is typically set to the number of CPU cores. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-lightning-configuration).\\n\\n- **Performance Tuning:** To reduce the impact on cluster performance, you can limit the bandwidth for writing data to TiKV nodes using `store-write-bwlimit` and adjust the concurrency for checksum and analyze operations with `distsql-scan-concurrency`. These settings help balance import speed with cluster stability. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode-usage).\\n\\n**2. Logical Import Mode:**\\n\\n- **Batch Size and Rows:** The `logical-import-batch-size` and `logical-import-batch-rows` parameters control the size of SQL statements and the number of rows per transaction, respectively. These settings help manage transaction size and reduce stress on the cluster. The default batch size is 96KiB, and the default number of rows is 65536. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-lightning-configuration).\\n\\n- **Prepared Statements:** The `logical-import-prep-stmt` parameter, when enabled, uses prepared statements and a statement cache to improve performance. This is particularly useful for large-scale imports where transaction efficiency is critical. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-lightning-configuration).\\n\\n### Best Practices\\n\\n- **Data Volume Considerations:** For large datasets (greater than 1 TiB), the physical import mode is recommended due to its high performance and ability to handle large volumes efficiently. However, this mode requires the target TiDB cluster to be unavailable for other services during import. For smaller datasets (less than 1 TiB), the logical import mode is suitable as it allows the cluster to remain operational during the import process.\\n\\n- **Deployment Scenarios:** TiDB Lightning is resource-intensive, and it is best deployed on a dedicated machine with sufficient CPU, memory, and storage resources. If deployed alongside other components, limit its CPU usage to prevent resource contention. A 10-Gigabit network card is recommended to handle the data transfer efficiently. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v5.4/deploy-tidb-lightning).\\n\\n- **Ensuring Data Integrity:** TiDB Lightning performs checksums on the local data source and imported tables by default. This ensures data integrity and consistency. Users can also manually verify data integrity using the `ADMIN CHECKSUM TABLE` SQL command. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/tidb-lightning-faq).\\n\\nBy carefully configuring these parameters and following best practices, users can optimize TiDB Lightning for their specific data import needs, ensuring efficient and reliable data migration into TiDB clusters.\\n\\nVerification Summary:\\nAfter reviewing the detailed explanation of TiDB Lightning\\'s configuration and best practices, here is a concise verification summary:\\n\\n### Verification Summary\\n\\n1. **Physical Import Mode:**\\n   - **PD Scheduling Scope:** The explanation correctly states that the `pause-pd-scheduler-scope` parameter can be set to `\"table\"` or `\"global\"`, with `\"global\"` being more suitable for clusters without business traffic. This feature is indeed available from version 7.1.0 onwards. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode-usage).\\n   - **Region Splitting:** The parameters `region-split-batch-size` and `region-split-concurrency` are accurately described, with default values and their role in optimizing the import process. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-lightning-configuration).\\n   - **Performance Tuning:** The use of `store-write-bwlimit` and `distsql-scan-concurrency` for balancing import speed and cluster stability is correctly outlined. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-lightning-physical-import-mode-usage).\\n\\n2. **Logical Import Mode:**\\n   - **Batch Size and Rows:** The parameters `logical-import-batch-size` and `logical-import-batch-rows` are correctly described, with default values provided. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-lightning-configuration).\\n   - **Prepared Statements:** The use of `logical-import-prep-stmt` for performance improvement is accurately mentioned. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-lightning-configuration).\\n\\n3. **Best Practices:**\\n   - **Data Volume Considerations:** The recommendation for using physical import mode for datasets larger than 1 TiB and logical import mode for smaller datasets is consistent with best practices.\\n   - **Deployment Scenarios:** The advice on deploying TiDB Lightning on a dedicated machine with sufficient resources and a 10-Gigabit network card is well-founded. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v5.4/deploy-tidb-lightning).\\n   - **Ensuring Data Integrity:** The explanation of checksum operations for data integrity is accurate. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/tidb-lightning-faq).\\n\\n### Additional Insights\\n\\n- It is important to regularly check for updates in the official documentation, as TiDB Lightning is actively developed, and new features or changes in configuration parameters may be introduced in newer versions.\\n- Users should also consider the specific characteristics of their TiDB cluster and workload when applying these configurations and best practices to ensure optimal performance and data integrity.\\n\\nBy following these verified configurations and best practices, users can effectively optimize TiDB Lightning for their data import needs.', 'reasoning': \"Alright, I need to update the plan based on the user's suggestions. Let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. The goal is to provide information on the routing options and configurations available for TiDB Lightning. The current plan uses three steps: retrieving knowledge, vector search for best practices, and generating a detailed explanation.\\n\\nThe user's suggestion is to add more granular details on routing-specific parameters like PD scheduling scopes, region splitting settings, and their impact on import modes. They also want a consolidated summary that covers these parameters and distinguishes best practices for different data volumes and deployment scenarios. Additionally, a verification step to cross-reference version-specific changes and performance tuning recommendations from multiple sources is recommended.\\n\\nFirst, I need to assess how the current plan can be modified. The current plan retrieves knowledge and does a vector search, then generates an explanation. To incorporate the suggestions, I should add steps to retrieve more detailed information on specific routing parameters.\\n\\nI can introduce a new step after the initial vector search to perform another vector search focused on these specific parameters. This way, we gather more detailed information that can be used in the final explanation.\\n\\nNext, I need to modify the llm_generate step to explicitly ask for a consolidated summary that includes these parameters and best practices. The prompt should guide the LLM to structure the explanation accordingly.\\n\\nAdditionally, adding a verification step using llm_generate to cross-reference version-specific changes and performance tuning from multiple sources would ensure the answer is comprehensive and accurate. This step would help in validating the information gathered.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that all steps are properly integrated into the plan structure, maintaining sequential execution and correct variable references. Each new step should be assigned a new seq_no, and variables should be updated accordingly.\\n\\nFinally, I must ensure that the final answer variable is correctly assigned and that the plan adheres to the VM specifications, such as using only the allowed tools and maintaining proper JSON formatting.\\n\\nSo, the plan will now include an additional vector search for specific parameters, an updated llm_generate prompt, and a verification step.

Also, they mentioned modifying the llm_generate step to explicitly state that TiDB doesn't have a supported method to skip DDL unless in specific cases. Plus, clarifying version-dependent behaviors and manual recovery steps would make the answer clearer.\\n\\nThe current plan has three steps: vector_search, retrieve_knowledge_graph, and llm_generate. The program counter is at 3, meaning all steps have been executed, and the final answer is being assigned. But the suggestion is to add a new step after the llm_generate step to verify with the latest documentation.\\n\\nSo, I need to add a new calling instruction that uses vector_search with a query about the latest DDL management commands. This will gather any new information that might not be in the knowledge graph. Then, I should modify the llm_generate step to include this new information in its context.\\n\\nWait, but the vector_search step needs to come before the llm_generate step so that the new information can be used as context. However, the program counter is already at 3, meaning all steps have been executed. So, I can't insert a new step before the llm_generate step without altering the existing plan structure.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can add a new step after the llm_generate step. But since the final answer is already assigned, I need to adjust the flow. Maybe after generating the initial answer, I can add a verification step and then update the answer based on that.\\n\\nBut looking back, the user's suggestion is to add an extra verification step. So, perhaps after the initial llm_generate step, I can add another vector_search to check the latest documentation and then another llm_generate step to incorporate that information.\\n\\nWait, but the user wants to keep all steps up to and including step 2 unchanged. So, I can't modify the existing steps, only add new ones after.\\n\\nSo, the plan would be:\\n\\n1. Keep the existing steps 0, 1, and 2 as they are.\\n2. After step 2, add a new step (seq_no 3) to perform vector_search for the latest DDL management commands.\\n3. Then, add another step (seq_no 4) to use llm_generate, including the new information from the vector_search.\\n\\nBut wait, the current plan's step 3 is an assign instruction that sets final_answer to synthesized_answer. So, if I add new steps after step 2, I need to adjust the assign step to come after the new steps.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the assign step can be moved to the end after the new steps.\\n\\nLet me outline the steps:\\n\\n- Step 0: vector_search for TiDB DDL handling.\\n- Step 1: retrieve_knowledge_graph for DDL management.\\n- Step 2: llm_generate to create the initial answer.\\n- Step 3: vector_search for latest DDL commands.\\n- Step 4: llm_generate to update the answer with new info.\\n- Step 5: assign the final answer.\\n\\nBut the original plan's step 3 is the assign instruction.

So, the existing plan is:\\n\\n0: vector_search\\n1: retrieve_knowledge_graph\\n2: llm_generate\\n3: assign\\n\\nTo add the new steps, I need to insert them after step 2 but before step 3.

So, perhaps the best way is to add the new steps after step 2 and then adjust the assign step to use the updated answer.\\n\\nBut the user's instruction says to keep all steps up to and including step 2 unchanged. So, I can't modify steps 0-2. I can only add new steps after step 2.\\n\\nTherefore, the new plan would have:\\n\\n- Steps 0-2 as before.\\n- Step 3: vector_search for latest DDL commands.\\n- Step 4: llm_generate to update the answer.\\n- Step 5: assign the final answer.\\n\\nBut in the original plan, step 3 is the assign instruction.

Therefore, I need to add the new steps after step 3, but that doesn't make sense because the final answer is already assigned.\\n\\nHmm, perhaps the solution is to add the verification step after the initial llm_generate step but before the assign. So, the flow would be:\\n\\n0: vector_search\\n1: retrieve_knowledge_graph\\n2: llm_generate (initial answer)\\n3: vector_search (latest commands)\\n4: llm_generate (update answer)\\n5: assign\\n\\nBut in the original plan, step 3 is the assign. So, to incorporate the new steps, I need to modify the plan to include steps 3 and 4 as the new vector_search and llm_generate, and then step 5 as the assign.\\n\\nTherefore, the updated plan would have:\\n\\n- Steps 0-2 unchanged.\\n- Step 3: vector_search for latest DDL commands.\\n- Step 4: llm_generate to create the final answer, incorporating the new info.\\n- Step 5: assign the final answer.\\n\\nBut the original step 3 is the assign, so I need to adjust the sequence numbers accordingly.\\n\\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to add the new steps after step 2 and before the assign step.

DDL operations in TiDB are designed to be executed online and asynchronously, allowing schema changes without blocking DML operations. This design ensures that applications can continue running smoothly while DDL changes are being applied. However, there are important considerations and best practices to keep in mind:\\n\\n1. **Cancellation vs. Skipping**: While TiDB allows for the cancellation of DDL operations, skipping an executing DDL statement is not a typical feature. Canceling a DDL operation can be useful if it is taking too long or was initiated by mistake. However, it can leave the database in an inconsistent state if not handled properly. Therefore, any cancellation should be followed by appropriate checks and corrective actions.\\n\\n2. **Implications of Skipping**: Skipping a DDL operation could lead to incomplete schema changes, resulting in data inconsistency or corruption. It is crucial to ensure that any DDL operation is fully completed to maintain the integrity of the database schema.\\n\\n3. **Best Practices**:\\n   - **Monitoring**: Use the `ADMIN SHOW DDL` command to monitor ongoing DDL operations. This helps in understanding the current state of DDL tasks and making informed decisions about whether to cancel or let them complete.\\n   - **Resource Management**: Adjust the resources allocated to DDL operations, such as the number of workers and batch sizes, to manage their impact on system performance. This can help in reducing the need to cancel or skip operations due to performance concerns.\\n   - **Planning**: Schedule DDL operations during low-traffic periods to minimize their impact on application performance and reduce the likelihood of needing to cancel them.\\n\\n4. **Handling Errors**: If a DDL operation encounters errors, TiDB provides mechanisms to handle these scenarios. It is important to address any errors promptly to ensure that the database remains in a consistent state.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on TiDB DDL operations and best practices, you can refer to the following sources:\\n- [Execution Principles and Best Practices of DDL Statements](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/ddl-introduction)\\n- [SQL FAQ - DDL Execution](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/sql-faq#ddl-execution)', 'reasoning': \"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to update the plan based on the user's suggestions.

This means that DML (Data Manipulation Language) operations can continue concurrently, which is crucial for maintaining application availability during schema modifications.\\n\\n### Can a User Skip an Executing DDL Statement?\\n\\nIn general, TiDB does not provide a direct mechanism to \"skip\" an executing DDL statement if it is running without errors. DDL operations are typically executed in a controlled manner to ensure data integrity and consistency across the database. However, users can cancel a DDL operation if necessary, using administrative commands. This is particularly useful if a DDL operation is taking too long or was initiated by mistake. It\\'s important to note that canceling a DDL operation can lead to inconsistencies if not managed properly, so it should be done with caution.\\n\\n### Implications and Best Practices\\n\\n1. **Cancellation Considerations**:\\n   - Canceling a DDL operation should be a well-considered decision. It is crucial to understand the potential impact on the database schema and any ongoing transactions. If a DDL operation is canceled, it may leave the database in an inconsistent state, requiring manual intervention to resolve.\\n\\n2. **Performance Management**:\\n   - TiDB allows for the adjustment of system variables to control the concurrency and batch size of DDL operations, such as adding indexes. This flexibility helps balance the speed of DDL execution with the system load, minimizing the impact on other applications.\\n\\n3. **Monitoring and Adjustment**:\\n   - Regular monitoring of system resources is recommended to ensure that DDL operations do not adversely affect the performance of other applications. Adjusting the system variables based on current resource usage can help maintain optimal performance.\\n\\n4. **Handling Edge Cases**:\\n   - In earlier versions of TiDB, the DDL execution framework had limitations, such as processing DDL jobs in a strict first-in-first-out manner. This could lead to unintended blocking behavior. However, improvements in later versions allow for more flexible execution, supporting parallel execution of non-dependent DDL tasks.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on the execution principles and best practices of DDL statements in TiDB, you can refer to the official documentation [here](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/ddl-introduction).', 'reasoning': \"Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to update the plan based on the user's suggestions.

Skipping an executing DDL operation could lead to inconsistencies in the database schema, which might affect data integrity and lead to unexpected behavior in applications relying on the database.\\n\\n2. **Error Handling**: TiDB provides mechanisms to manage DDL operations, such as the `ADMIN CANCEL DDL` command, which allows users to cancel a running DDL job if necessary. This command should be used with caution, as canceling a DDL operation can leave the database in an intermediate state if not handled properly. For more details on canceling DDL jobs, you can refer to the [TiDB documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/sql-statement-admin-cancel-ddl).\\n\\n3. **System Stability**: Allowing DDL operations to complete as intended ensures that the system remains stable. Interrupting or skipping these operations can lead to system instability, especially if the operation is part of a larger transaction or if it involves significant changes to the database structure.\\n\\n4. **Best Practices**: It is advisable to monitor DDL operations using commands like `ADMIN SHOW DDL JOBS` to understand their status and progress. This allows for informed decision-making regarding whether to let an operation complete or to intervene if necessary. Additionally, scheduling DDL operations during off-peak hours can minimize their impact on system performance and user experience.\\n\\nIn summary, while TiDB provides tools to manage DDL operations, skipping an executing DDL statement is not a standard practice and should be avoided to maintain data consistency and system stability. Proper monitoring and management of DDL operations are essential to ensure the smooth operation of the database system.

Doing so can have significant implications for data consistency, error handling, and system stability.\\n\\n### Implications of Skipping an Executing DDL Statement\\n\\n1. **Data Consistency**: DDL operations in TiDB, such as adding an index or altering a table, are designed to be executed in a way that maintains data consistency across the distributed database. Skipping a DDL operation could lead to an inconsistent state where some nodes have applied the change while others have not, potentially resulting in data anomalies or corruption.\\n\\n2. **Error Handling**: If a DDL operation is skipped, it may not be possible to properly handle any errors that arise from the incomplete execution. This could leave the database in an unpredictable state, making it difficult to diagnose and resolve issues.\\n\\n3. **System Stability**: The stability of the TiDB system could be compromised if DDL operations are not allowed to complete as intended. DDL operations are typically resource-intensive and are managed carefully to ensure they do not disrupt ongoing transactions. Interrupting these operations could lead to system instability or performance degradation.\\n\\n### Best Practices for Managing DDL Operations\\n\\n1. **Monitoring and Management**: Use the `ADMIN SHOW DDL` command to monitor ongoing DDL jobs. This allows you to track the progress of DDL operations and make informed decisions about managing them. If necessary, you can use the `ADMIN CANCEL DDL` command to cancel a DDL job that is causing issues, but this should be done with caution and understanding of the potential impacts.\\n\\n2. **Avoiding DDL During Peak Times**: Schedule DDL operations during periods of low activity to minimize their impact on system performance and user transactions. This helps ensure that the operations can complete without causing significant disruption.\\n\\n3. **Testing and Validation**: Before executing DDL operations in a production environment, test them in a staging environment to validate their behavior and performance. This can help identify potential issues and ensure that the operations will not adversely affect the production system.\\n\\n4. **Upgrading Considerations**: When upgrading TiDB, it is recommended to avoid executing DDL statements during the upgrade process, especially for versions prior to v7.1.0. This helps prevent undefined behavior and ensures a smooth upgrade process. For more details, refer to the [TiDB Upgrade FAQ](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/upgrade-faq).\\n\\nBy following these best practices, you can effectively manage DDL operations in TiDB, ensuring data consistency, robust error handling, and system stability.

在第一步收集健康检查数据时，除了使用tiup命令外，还应明确调用PD提供的区域状态监控命令，比如pd-ctl region，以获取详细的不健康Region信息。\\n2. 在诊断部分，增加具体的故障场景说明，如Region异常、选举失败等，并提供修复步骤，比如使用pd-ctl operator add命令进行调度。\\n3. 在生成修复计划时，增加更多实操性细节，如详细说明如何使用pd-ctl命令进行区域调度，结合监控系统如Prometheus/Grafana进行反馈调整。\\n\\n我需要将这些建议整合到现有的计划中，同时保持原有步骤的结构。首先，我应该在信息收集阶段增加使用pd-ctl命令的步骤，以获取更详细的数据。然后，在诊断阶段，增加对具体故障场景的分析，并生成相应的修复步骤。最后，在生成修复计划时，确保包含具体的命令和参数，以及如何结合监控系统进行调整。\\n\\n接下来，我需要考虑如何在现有的计划中添加这些步骤。由于当前的程序计数器是2，已经执行了前两个步骤，我需要从第三个步骤开始修改。我应该在第三个步骤中，增加对pd-ctl命令的调用，以获取不健康区域的详细信息，并将其存储为一个变量。然后，在第四个步骤中，使用llm_generate工具，将这些信息与之前检索到的知识图谱和向量搜索结果结合起来，生成一个更详细和具体的修复计划。\\n\\n同时，我需要确保所有步骤都符合VM的规范，比如变量引用的正确性，以及工具的正确调用。此外，我需要避免使用任何未定义的工具，只使用retrieve_knowledge_graph、vector_search和llm_generate这三个工具。\\n\\n最后，我需要确保最终的修复计划不仅包含诊断步骤，还包括具体的修复命令，如pd-ctl

'要生成一个详细的修复计划以解决 TiDB 集群中不健康的 Region 问题，我们可以按照以下步骤进行：\\n\\n### 故障场景分析\\n\\n1. **不健康 Region 的识别**：\\n   - 使用 `pd-ctl` 工具连接到 PD 服务器，获取不健康的 Region 列表。\\n   - 通过 `region --jq=\\'.regions[] | select(.status != \"UP\")\\'` 命令识别出所有状态不是 \"UP\" 的 Region。\\n\\n2. **问题诊断**：\\n   - 检查每个不健康 Region 的详细信息，包括其副本状态和所在的 Store。\\n   - 确认是否有副本丢失、不可用或在错误的 Store 上。\\n   - 查看 Store 的状态，确认是否有 Store 出现故障。\\n\\n3. **调度历史分析**：\\n   - 使用 `scheduler show` 和 `operator show` 命令查看最近的调度和操作历史。\\n   - 确认是否有调度操作导致了 Region 的不健康状态。\\n\\n4. **日志检查**：\\n   - 查看 PD 和 TiKV 的日志文件，寻找可能的错误信息或警告。\\n\\n### 修复步骤\\n\\n1. **修复副本**：\\n   - 如果发现副本丢失或不可用，可以使用 `pd-ctl` 的 `operator add` 命令手动调度副本。例如：\\n     ```bash\\n     operator add add-peer <region_id> <store_id>\\n     ```\\n   - 确保每个 Region 有足够的副本分布在不同的 Store 上。\\n\\n2. **调整调度策略**：\\n   - 如果调度策略导致了不健康的 Region，可以调整 PD 的调度策略。例如，增加或减少调度器的优先级。\\n   - 使用 `config show all` 查看当前的调度配置，并根据需要进行调整。\\n\\n3. **网络和硬件检查**：\\n   - 确保网络连接正常，硬件没有故障。\\n   - 如果某个 Store 出现问题，考虑将其下线并迁移其上的数据。\\n\\n### 结合监控系统进行反馈调整\\n\\n1. **监控系统设置**：\\n   - 使用 Prometheus 和 Grafana 监控 TiDB 集群的健康状态。\\n   - 设置告警规则，及时发现和响应不健康的 Region。\\n\\n2. **实时监控和调整**：\\n   - 通过 Grafana 仪表盘监控关键指标，如 Region Health、Store 状态、调度器活动等。\\n   - 根据监控数据，实时调整调度策略和操作。\\n\\n3. **持续优化**：\\n   - 定期审查监控数据和日志，识别潜在问题。\\n   - 根据历史数据和趋势，优化集群配置和调度策略。\\n\\n通过以上步骤，可以有效地识别、分析和修复 TiDB 集群中不健康的 Region 问题，并通过监控系统进行持续的反馈和优化。', 'reasoning': '嗯，我现在需要帮用户分析如何修复不健康的TiDB区域。用户已经提供了一个现有的计划，并提出了改进建议。我的任务是根据这些建议，更新现有的计划，使其更精确和实用。\\n\\n首先，我得理解现有的计划。计划分为几个步骤，从问题分析、信息收集到生成修复计划。现有的步骤已经包括了使用retrieve_knowledge_graph和vector_search来获取信息，然后用llm_generate生成修复计划。但用户认为这个计划不够具体，缺乏实际操作的命令和详细的诊断步骤。\\n\\n用户建议在现有步骤之外增加以下改进：\\n\\n1. 在第一步收集健康检查数据时，除了使用tiup命令外，还应明确调用PD提供的区域状态监控命令，比如pd-ctl region，以获取详细的不健康Region信息。\\n2. 在诊断部分，增加具体的故障场景说明，如Region异常、选举失败等，并提供修复步骤，比如使用pd-ctl operator add命令进行调度。\\n3. 在生成修复计划时，增加更多实操性细节，如详细说明如何使用pd-ctl命令进行区域调度，结合监控系统如Prometheus/Grafana进行反馈调整。\\n\\n我需要将这些建议整合到现有的计划中，同时保持原有步骤的结构。首先，我应该在信息收集阶段增加使用pd-ctl命令的步骤，以获取更详细的数据。然后，在诊断阶段，增加对具体故障场景的分析，并生成相应的修复步骤。最后，在生成修复计划时，确保包含具体的命令和参数，以及如何结合监控系统进行调整。\\n\\n接下来，我需要考虑如何在现有的计划中添加这些步骤。由于当前的程序计数器是2，已经执行了前两个步骤，我需要从第三个步骤开始修改。我应该在第三个步骤中，增加对pd-ctl命令的调用，以获取不健康区域的详细信息，并将其存储为一个变量。然后，在第四个步骤中，使用llm_generate工具，将这些信息与之前检索到的知识图谱和向量搜索结果结合起来，生成一个更详细和具体的修复计划。\\n\\n同时，我需要确保所有步骤都符合VM的规范，比如变量引用的正确性，以及工具的正确调用。此外，我需要避免使用任何未定义的工具，只使用retrieve_knowledge_graph、vector_search和llm_generate这三个工具。\\n\\n最后，我需要确保最终的修复计划不仅包含诊断步骤，还包括具体的修复命令，如pd-ctl operator add，以及如何结合监控系统进行后续调整。这样，用户可以根据生成的计划，直接执行相应的命令，修复不健康的区域。\\n\\n总结一下，我需要在现有的计划中，增加使用pd-ctl命令获取详细区域状态的步骤，并在生成修复计划时，包含具体的故障场景和修复命令，使计划更具操作性和针对性。', 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts':

Python 示例，展示如何动态设置 `LIMIT` 参数：\\n\\n```python\\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, text\\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\\nfrom sqlalchemy.exc import SQLAlchemyError\\n\\nengine = create_engine(\\'mysql+pymysql://user:password@localhost/dbname\\')\\nSession = sessionmaker(bind=engine)\\n\\ndef process_data(batch):\\n    print(f\"Processing batch: {batch}\")\\n\\ndef fetch_data_with_limit(limit):\\n    session = Session()\\n    try:\\n        session.begin()\\n        query = text(f\"DELETE FROM your_table WHERE condition LIMIT :limit\")\\n        result = session.execute(query, {\\'limit\\': limit})\\n        session.commit()\\n    except SQLAlchemyError as e:\\n        session.rollback()\\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\\n    finally:\\n        session.close()\\n\\ndef main():\\n    limit = 100\\n    while True:\\n        fetch_data_with_limit(limit)\\n        # 添加条件以退出循环，例如当没有更多数据时\\n        # if no_more_data:\\n        #

`try-except-finally` 结构来捕获和处理 SQLAlchemy 的异常，确保即使在出现错误时也能安全地回滚事务。\\n\\n### 4. GC 机制优化建议\\nTiDB 的垃圾回收（GC）机制不会立即释放删除的数据空间，而是标记为待删除，并在 GC 过程中清理。默认情况下，GC 每 10 分钟触发一次。为了优化删除后的空间回收，可以考虑以下几点：\\n\\n- 确保 GC 配置合理，例如 `tidb_gc_life_time` 设置为合适的时间间隔，以平衡数据保留和空间回收。\\n- 在大规模删除后，手动触发 GC 以加速空间回收。\\n- 更新统计信息以确保优化器能够正确选择索引，从而提高后续查询的性能。\\n\\n更多关于 TiDB GC 机制的信息可以参考 [GC 机制文档](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/garbage-collection-overview)。\\n\\n通过以上步骤，可以有效地优化在 TiDB 中使用 `LIMIT` 删除大量数据的性能。', 'reasoning': '好的，我现在需要帮助用户更新他们的计划，以更高效地删除TiDB中的大量数据。用户已经提供了当前的计划和一些建议，我需要分析这些建议并调整计划以满足需求。\\n\\n首先，我回顾了用户当前的计划，发现他们已经使用了`retrieve_knowledge_graph`和`vector_search`来获取相关信息，并通过`llm_generate`生成最终的指导。但用户建议进一步改进，包括添加示例代码、验证TiDB版本以及优化GC机制。\\n\\n接下来，我分析了这些建议。添加示例代码可以帮助用户更直观地理解如何动态设置LIMIT值和处理事务。验证TiDB版本确保建议适用于用户的环境，避免无效的优化。优化GC机制可以加快数据清理，提升整体性能。\\n\\n我决定在计划中添加两个新的步骤：一个用于生成示例代码，另一个用于强调GC优化。同时，我会修改现有的`llm_generate`步骤，确保其包含版本验证和示例代码。\\n\\n最后，我确保所有的变量引用和步骤顺序正确，避免依赖问题。这样，更新后的计划将更全面，帮助用户更有效地优化他们的删除操作。', 'plan': [{'parameters': {'goal': '优化在 TiDB 中使用 LIMIT 删除大量数据的性能'}, 'seq_no': 0, 'type': 'assign'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['delete_optimization_knowledge'], 'tool_name': 'retrieve_knowledge_graph', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB DELETE 操作性能优化'}}, 'seq_no': 1, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['delete_optimization_snippets'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB 使用 LIMIT 删除数据的优化技巧', 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 2, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['example_code'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': '生成动态设置LIMIT参数的示例代码，展示如何在循环中处理事务和异常。', 'prompt': '请生成一个动态设置LIMIT参数的示例代码，展示如何在循环中处理事务和异常。请使用中文。'}}, 'seq_no': 3, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['final_answer'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': '知识图谱信息：${delete_optimization_knowledge}\\n文档片段：${delete_optimization_snippets}\\n示例代码：${example_code}', 'prompt': '结合知识图谱信息、文档片段和示例代码，生成一个详细的行动方案，优化在 TiDB 中使用 LIMIT 删除大量数据的性能。请确保包括以下内容：\\n1. 验证TiDB版本（例如5.0及以上）\\n2. 动态设置LIMIT参数的建议\\n3. 事务管理和异常处理\\n4.

GC机制优化建议\\nTiDB的垃圾回收（GC）机制用于清理不再需要的历史版本数据。以下是优化GC的建议：\\n\\n- **调整`tidb_gc_life_time`参数**：根据业务需求调整数据保留时间。例如，将保留时间设置为1小时：\\n  ```sql\\n  SET GLOBAL tidb_gc_life_time = \\'1h\\';\\n  ```\\n- **手动触发GC清理**：在业务低峰期手动触发GC清理，以减少对正常业务操作的影响：\\n  ```sql\\n  ADMIN CHECK TABLE <table_name>;\\n  ADMIN CLEANUP TABLE LOCK <table_name>;\\n  ```\\n\\n通过以上步骤，您可以有效地优化在TiDB中使用`LIMIT`删除大量数据的性能，确保数据库的高效运行。\\n\\n参考文档：\\n- [TiDB删除数据指南](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/dev-guide-delete-data)\\n- [TiDB 5.0 RC发布说明](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-5.0.0-rc)', 'reasoning': '好，我现在需要帮助用户更新他们的计划，以更高效地删除TiDB中的大量数据。用户已经提供了当前的计划和一些建议，我需要分析这些建议并调整计划以满足需求。\\n\\n首先，我回顾了用户当前的计划，发现他们已经使用了`retrieve_knowledge_graph`和`vector_search`来获取相关信息，并通过`llm_generate`生成最终的指导。但用户建议进一步改进，包括添加示例代码、验证TiDB版本以及优化GC机制。\\n\\n接下来，我分析了这些建议。添加示例代码可以帮助用户更直观地理解如何动态设置LIMIT值和处理事务。验证TiDB版本确保建议适用于用户的环境，避免无效的优化。优化GC机制可以加快数据清理，提升整体性能。\\n\\n我决定在计划中添加两个新的步骤：一个用于生成示例代码，另一个用于强调GC优化。同时，我会修改现有的`llm_generate`步骤，确保其包含版本验证和示例代码。\\n\\n最后，我确保所有的变量引用和步骤顺序正确，避免依赖问题。这样，更新后的计划将更全面，帮助用户更有效地优化他们的删除操作。', 'plan': [{'parameters': {'goal': '如何高效地使用 LIMIT 从 TiDB 表中删除大量数据'}, 'seq_no': 0, 'type': 'assign'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['delete_optimization_knowledge'], 'tool_name': 'retrieve_knowledge_graph', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB DELETE 操作性能优化'}}, 'seq_no': 1, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['delete_optimization_snippets'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB 使用 LIMIT 删除数据的优化技巧', 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 2, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['example_code'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': '生成动态设置LIMIT参数的示例代码，展示如何在循环中处理事务和异常。', 'prompt': '请生成一个动态设置LIMIT参数的示例代码，展示如何在循环中处理事务和异常。请使用中文。'}}, 'seq_no': 3, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['gc_optimization'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': '展示如何调整GC配置和手动触发GC清理。', 'prompt': '请详细说明如何调整GC配置（如tidb_gc_life_time）以及手动触发GC清理的方法，确保删除操作对后续查询性能的影响降到最低。请使用中文。'}}, 'seq_no': 4, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['final_answer'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': '知识图谱检索信息：${delete_optimization_knowledge}\\n文档片段：${delete_optimization_snippets}\\n示例代码：${example_code}\\nGC优化：${gc_optimization}', 'prompt': '综合知识图谱检索信息、文档片段、示例代码和GC优化建议，生成一个详细的行动方案，优化在TiDB中使用LIMIT删除大量数据的性能。请确保包括以下内容：\\n1. 验证TiDB版本（例如5.0及以上）\\n2. 动态设置LIMIT参数的建议\\n3. 事务管理和异常处理\\n4.

在调整全局变量时，需考虑到并发连接的数量，因为大多数设置会应用于每个连接。\\n  - 变量的单位也需要注意，例如线程数通常与 CPU 核心数相关，字节数应小于系统内存量。\\n\\n通过以上机制，TiDB 确保了全局变量在集群中的一致性和有效性，特别是在集群拓扑发生变化时（如新实例加入或实例重启）。更多详细信息可以参考 [TiDB 文档](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/system-variables) 和 [TiDB Cloud 文档](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/system-variables)。\", 'reasoning': '嗯，我现在需要分析用户关于TiDB全局变量如何在多个实例之间生效的问题，并根据提供的建议更新现有的执行计划。首先，我得理解当前的执行计划是什么样的，以及用户的建议有哪些改进点。\\n\\n当前计划包括三个主要步骤：检索知识图谱、向量搜索文档，然后生成最终答案。用户建议添加一个新的检索步骤，修改向量搜索的查询，以及在生成答案时加入验证步骤，以确保涵盖所有边缘案例。\\n\\n首先，我需要评估这些建议是否有助于实现目标。添加关于集群架构和同步机制的信息检索，确实能提供更全面的背景知识，有助于解释全局变量的传播机制。修改向量搜索的查询，使其更具体，有助于获取更详细的技术细节，比如事件广播机制。最后，在生成答案时加入验证步骤，确保所有可能的场景都被覆盖，这有助于提高回答的准确性。\\n\\n接下来，我需要考虑如何将这些建议整合到现有的计划中。由于当前程序计数器在1，所以新步骤应该从1开始插入。首先，添加一个新的检索步骤，使用`retrieve_knowledge_graph`工具，查询关于TiDB集群架构和同步机制的信息。然后，修改现有的向量搜索步骤，更新查询语句，使其更具体。最后，在生成答案之前，添加一个验证步骤，确保所有场景都被涵盖。\\n\\n在实现这些步骤时，需要注意变量的引用和依赖关系。例如，新的检索步骤会生成一个新的变量，如`cluster_architecture_graph`，然后向量搜索会生成另一个变量，如`global_variable_synchronization_details`。在生成最终答案时，需要同时引用这些变量，以确保信息的全面性。\\n\\n此外，还要确保生成的最终答案是用中文书写的，并且涵盖了所有重要的信息，包括新实例加入、重启等边缘案例。这可能需要在生成步骤中加入额外的提示，以确保LLM生成的内容符合这些要求。\\n\\n最后，我需要确保整个计划的结构符合VM的规范，变量名和步骤顺序正确，没有遗漏任何必要的步骤。同时，避免使用任何未定义的变量，以防止执行时出现错误。\\n\\n总结一下，我需要添加一个新的检索步骤，修改向量搜索的查询，然后在生成答案时加入验证步骤，以确保所有信息都被涵盖。这将使计划更加全面和准确，更好地回答用户的问题。', 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': '为了理解TiDB中全局变量如何在多个实例之间生效，我们将：1. 检索关于TiDB全局变量管理的结构化信息。2. 使用向量搜索获取有关全局变量同步的详细文档。3. 检索最新的TiDB集群架构和同步机制说明。4. 合成所有信息，提供全面的解释，包括SQL操作示例。', 'dependency_analysis': '步骤1、2和3是独立的。步骤4依赖于步骤1、2和3的信息。'}, 'seq_no': 0, 'type': 'reasoning'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['global_variable_management_graph'], 'tool_name': 'retrieve_knowledge_graph', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB全局变量管理与同步'}}, 'seq_no': 1, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['cluster_architecture_graph'], 'tool_name': 'retrieve_knowledge_graph', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB集群架构与同步机制'}}, 'seq_no': 2, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['global_variable_synchronization_docs'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB全局变量同步传播细节', 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 3, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['final_answer'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': '知识图谱数据: ${global_variable_management_graph}\\n文档: ${global_variable_synchronization_docs}\\n雄须栏板標数据: ${cluster_architecture_graph}', 'prompt': '根据提供的知识图谱数据和文档，解释 TiDB 中全局变量在多个实例之间的生效机制。请详细说明同步过程和相关配置，必要时包括 SQL 操作示例。请确保生成的文本使用中文。请检验所有的同步地性情况，如新实例加入、重吨等，以确保文本已包含所有重要事情。'}}, 'seq_no': 4, 'type': 'calling'}]}, {'commit_hash': '1d227435532a466084c5dac16d5370f0', 'committed_at': '2025-02-20T12:29:35', 'description': \"Executed seq_no: 5, step: 'calling', tool: llm_generate\", 'seq_no': 5, 'commit_type': 'StepExecution', 'parent_hash': 'd4ac3de897984a06a9b87276a657b53c', 'final_answer': '在TiDB中，全局变量的生效机制涉及多个实例之间的同步和配置管理。全局变量可以影响整个TiDB集群的行为，并且可以通过SQL语句进行设置和修改。以下是TiDB中全局变量的生效机制和相关配置的详细说明：\\n\\n### 全局变量的同步机制\\n\\n1. **全局变量的设置**：\\n   - 全局变量可以通过`SET GLOBAL`语句进行设置。例如，要设置`tidb_distsql_scan_concurrency`的全局值，可以使用以下SQL语句：\\n     ```sql\\n     SET GLOBAL tidb_distsql_scan_concurrency = 10;\\n     ```\\n   - 这种设置会立即生效，并影响所有新的会话。\\n\\n2. **变量的持久化**：\\n   -

**近似值**: 由于 `Approximate_Size` 和 `Disk_Size` 都是近似值，因此在评估时应考虑到可能的误差。\\n\\n3. **监控工具**: 使用 Grafana 等监控工具来实时监控和分析存储空间的使用情况，以便更准确地进行容量规划和优化。\\n\\n通过以上步骤和策略，您可以更好地了解 TiDB 中表的实际存储空间使用情况。如需更多详细信息，请参考 [TiDB 官方文档](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/manage-cluster-faq)。', 'reasoning': '嗯，我现在需要帮助用户更新他们的虚拟机执行计划，以更好地实现他们的目标。目标是查看TiDB中一个表的实际使用空间。当前的计划已经包括了一些步骤，但用户提出了一些建议，我需要仔细分析这些建议，并更新计划以满足需求。\\n\\n首先，回顾一下当前的计划。计划从0开始，包括了推理、检索知识图谱、向量搜索和生成信息等步骤。当前的程序计数器在1，意味着已经执行了推理步骤，接下来是检索知识图谱。\\n\\n用户建议包括三个主要点：\\n1. 增加一个步骤，专门查阅TiDB的版本相关文档，确认TABLE_STORAGE_STATS是否在目标版本中可用，并处理不同版本下的使用差异。\\n2. 在检索知识图谱和向量搜索之前，添加版本确认和配置校验步骤，确保收集的信息在特定环境下有效。\\n3. 在生成阶段，增加对查询结果的详细解析，例如解释区域数量、空区域数量等字段，以及如何根据存储策略评估实际磁盘使用空间。\\n\\n分析这些建议，发现它们都是为了确保答案的准确性和全面性。特别是版本确认，因为不同的TiDB版本可能有不同的系统表或方法来查询存储空间。\\n\\n接下来，我需要将这些建议整合到当前的计划中。首先，在检索知识图谱之前，添加一个步骤来确认TiDB的版本。这可以通过调用`vector_search`工具，查询TiDB版本的文档，并提取相关信息。然后，根据版本信息，生成一个版本确认报告，存储在变量中。\\n\\n然后，继续执行现有的检索知识图谱和向量搜索步骤，但需要确保检索的内容是基于确认后的版本。这可能需要在检索时引用版本信息，以确保获取的信息适用于目标版本。\\n\\n在生成步骤中，除了生成SQL查询外，还需要详细解释查询结果中的各个字段，帮助用户更好地理解输出。这可以通过在`llm_generate`工具中添加额外的提示来实现，确保生成的说明包含对字段的解释和存储策略的评估方法。\\n\\n最后，确保所有步骤都正确地引用变量，并且变量存储在适当的位置，以便后续步骤可以正确访问。\\n\\n总结一下，更新后的计划应该包括以下步骤：\\n1. 推理步骤保持不变。\\n2. 添加版本确认步骤，包括向量搜索和生成版本报告。\\n3. 继续检索知识图谱和向量搜索，但基于确认的版本。\\n4. 在生成步骤中，增加对查询结果的详细解析。\\n5. 确保所有变量正确引用，保持计划的连贯性。\\n\\n这样，更新后的计划将更全面，确保在不同版本下都能提供准确的信息，并帮助用户更好地理解查询结果。', 'plan': [{'parameters':

The original plan involved retrieving knowledge from a knowledge graph and using vector search to gather documents, then generating a response with an LLM.\\n\\nThe user's suggestions point out a few areas for improvement. First, the vector search query should explicitly check for compatibility with the latest MySQL versions, like 8.4.4. Second, the LLM prompt needs to address the user's specific mention of 8.4.4 and clarify TiDB's compatibility, which is officially supported up to MySQL 8.0. Third, adding a step to fetch information from TiDB's official documentation would ensure the answer is up-to-date and reliable.\\n\\nLooking at the current plan, steps 1 and 2 have already been executed. Step 1 retrieved the knowledge graph data, and step 2 performed the vector search. Now, I need to modify the subsequent steps to incorporate the suggestions.\\n\\nI'll start by updating the vector search parameters to include a query that specifically checks for mentions of MySQL 8.4.4. This will help in verifying if TiDB is compatible with this version. Next, I'll add a new step to retrieve information from TiDB's official documentation using another vector search.

The open-source model provides several benefits, such as zero vendor lock-in, community-driven development, and the ability to customize solutions to meet specific needs. TiDB's open-source status is confirmed by its availability on platforms like GitHub, where its source code can be accessed and modified by anyone.\\n\\n### Licensing Terms\\n\\nTiDB is released under an open-source license, which typically allows users to use, modify, and distribute the software freely. However, it's important to review the specific license under which TiDB is released to understand any potential restrictions or obligations, such as attribution requirements or limitations on commercial use. The specific licensing terms can usually be found in the repository where the source code is hosted.\\n\\n### Commercial Offerings\\n\\nWhile TiDB itself is open-source, there are commercial offerings available that provide additional features and support. For instance, TiDB Cloud is a managed service that offers the benefits of TiDB with added convenience and support, which may come with associated costs. These commercial offerings are designed to provide enhanced services such as managed hosting, professional support, and additional tools that are not part of the free open-source version.\\n\\n### Comparative Analysis\\n\\nThe primary difference between the free open-source version of TiDB and its commercial offerings lies in the level of support and additional features provided. The open-source version is fully functional and can be used for a wide range of applications, but organizations that require enterprise-level support, managed services, or additional features may opt for the commercial offerings.\\n\\nFor more detailed information about TiDB and its integration with other tools like ProxySQL, you can refer to the following sources:\\n- [TiDB Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/overview)\\n- [ProxySQL Integration Guide](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/dev-guide-proxysql-integration)\\n\\nThese resources provide comprehensive insights into TiDB's capabilities, use cases, and integration options, helping users make informed decisions about its deployment and use.\", 'reasoning': 'Okay, so I need to update the plan based on the suggestions provided.

The Apache License 2.0 is known for its flexibility and is widely used in the open-source community.\\n\\n### Commercial Offerings\\n\\nWhile TiDB is free and open-source, there are commercial offerings available, such as TiDB Cloud. These commercial versions provide additional features and services, such as managed hosting, support, and enhanced security features, which are not available in the free open-source version. These services are typically offered on a subscription basis and are designed to provide enterprise-level support and convenience.\\n\\n### Potential Costs or Restrictions\\n\\nThe open-source version of TiDB does not have any inherent costs, but organizations may incur costs related to infrastructure, maintenance, and support if they choose to self-host and manage the database. Additionally, while the open-source version is feature-rich, organizations with specific needs may find value in the additional features and support provided by the commercial offerings.\\n\\n### Comparative Analysis\\n\\nThe primary difference between the free open-source version and the commercial offerings lies in the level of support and additional features provided. The open-source version is suitable for organizations that have the technical expertise to manage and maintain the database themselves. In contrast, the commercial offerings are tailored for organizations that prefer a managed solution with professional support.\\n\\nFor more detailed information about TiDB and its integration with ProxySQL, you can refer to the [ProxySQL Integration Guide](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/dev-guide-proxysql-integration).

The scalability of TiDB is primarily achieved through its architecture, which separates computing from storage. This design allows for online scaling of both resources without impacting applications, enabling TiDB to support a large number of users or tenants efficiently. This horizontal scalability ensures that as the demand grows, additional resources can be added seamlessly to accommodate more users or increased workloads.\\n\\nResource control in TiDB is a feature designed to manage and optimize resource allocation and usage across different tasks and queries. This feature is particularly useful in environments with multiple tenants or applications, as it allows for resource isolation and management through resource groups. Each resource group can have specific quotas set to limit resource consumption, ensuring that no single task or query can monopolize system resources. This is crucial for maintaining performance and stability, especially in multi-tenant environments where resource contention can be a significant issue.\\n\\nThe performance impact of resource control is generally positive, as it helps prevent resource-intensive queries from affecting the overall system performance. By using methodologies such as Request Unit (RU) and cgroup for resource quota management, TiDB can effectively isolate workloads and ensure that critical applications receive the necessary resources. This not only improves resource utilization but also enhances the performance of the database by reducing the impact of low-priority tasks on high-priority applications.\\n\\nMoreover, TiDB provides a built-in dashboard in Grafana to monitor resource usage, allowing administrators to track and manage resource allocation effectively.

This indicates that TiDB continues to evolve with enhancements that improve its efficiency and capacity to handle demanding workloads ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.2/benchmark-sysbench-v5.4.0-vs-v5.3.0)).\\n\\nIn summary, TiDB's scalability and resource control features make it a versatile choice for a wide range of applications. Its ability to scale horizontally and manage resources effectively ensures that it can support a large number of users or tenants, with performance largely dependent on the deployment strategy and resource allocation. For more detailed information on TiDB's resource control and scalability features, you can refer to the official documentation [here](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-6.6.0) and [here](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/tidb-resource-control).\", 'reasoning': \"Alright, let me walk through my thought process as I update the plan based on the suggestions and current execution state.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the goal: determining how many users or tenants TiDB can support and the performance impact of using resource control.

Here's an analysis of its capabilities:\\n\\n### Scalability\\n\\n**Horizontal Scalability**: TiDB's architecture separates computing from storage, allowing for seamless online scaling of resources without impacting applications. This design supports the dynamic addition or removal of nodes, which is crucial for handling varying workloads and user demands. The ability to scale horizontally means that TiDB can support a large number of users or tenants by simply adding more nodes to the cluster.\\n\\n**Cluster Scaling**: TiDB allows for the adjustment of cluster capacity by increasing or decreasing the number of nodes. This flexibility is essential for maintaining performance as the number of users grows. The system can efficiently handle thousands of concurrent users by scaling out the TiKV nodes, which are responsible for data storage and processing.\\n\\n### Resource Control\\n\\n**Resource Management**: TiDB includes features for managing resource allocation and usage across different tasks and queries. This is particularly important in multi-tenant environments where resource isolation is necessary to ensure that no single tenant can monopolize system resources. Resource groups can be used to allocate resources based on workload priorities, improving cluster stability and performance.\\n\\n**Performance Impact**: While resource control features are beneficial for managing workloads, they can introduce some performance overhead, especially in high concurrency or resource-intensive scenarios. The overhead is generally due to the additional processing required to enforce resource limits and priorities. However, the impact is often outweighed by the benefits of preventing resource contention and ensuring fair resource distribution among users.\\n\\n### Performance Benchmarks\\n\\nTiDB's performance has been benchmarked using various tools and scenarios. For instance, in a Sysbench performance test comparing TiDB versions 5.3.0 and 5.2.2, the results showed that the performance of v5.3.0 was nearly the same as that of v5.2.2, indicating stable performance across versions ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.1/benchmark-sysbench-v5.3.0-vs-v5.2.2)). Another test comparing v5.4.0 and v5.3.0 showed a performance improvement of 2.59% to 4.85% in write-heavy workloads ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.2/benchmark-sysbench-v5.4.0-vs-v5.3.0)).\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nTiDB's scalability and resource control features make it well-suited for environments with a large number of users or tenants. Its ability to scale horizontally and manage resources effectively ensures that it can handle high concurrency and resource-intensive scenarios with minimal performance degradation. The system's design and features provide both qualitative and quantitative benefits, supporting a wide range of applications and user demands.\", 'reasoning': 'Okay, so I\\'m trying to figure out how to update the plan based on the user\\'s suggestions. Let me start by understanding the current plan and the suggestions provided.\\n\\nThe goal is to determine how many users or tenants TiDB can support and the performance impact of using resource control. The current plan involves three steps: assigning the goal, retrieving knowledge about TiDB\\'s scalability and resource control, searching for documents on scalability and performance, and then generating a final answer using an LLM.\\n\\nThe user\\'s suggestion is to enhance the plan by adding a step to search for specific numerical benchmarks and guidelines regarding the maximum number of tenants or users TiDB can support. Additionally, they want the final answer to include both qualitative and quantitative insights, especially regarding performance overhead in high-concurrency or resource-intensive scenarios.\\n\\nSo, the first thing I need to do is identify where to insert this new step. Looking at the current plan, after retrieving the knowledge graph and performing vector search, the next logical step would be to search for specific numerical data. This would be step 3, before generating the final answer.\\n\\nNext, I need to modify the final LLM generation step to include the new data. The prompt should explicitly ask for both qualitative and quantitative insights, including performance metrics and benchmarks.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that the new step uses the appropriate tool, which is vector_search, with a query focused on numerical benchmarks and guidelines. The output from this step should be stored in a new variable, say \"scalability_benchmarks\", which will then be included in the context for the LLM generation.\\n\\nI should check if all variables are correctly referenced and that the sequence numbers are maintained properly. Also, I need to make sure that the final answer variable is correctly assigned and that all steps are in the right order.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'ll structure the updated plan, making sure to include the new step and adjust the LLM prompt accordingly.

The architecture of TiDB, which separates computing from storage, allows for online scaling of resources without impacting applications. This means that as the demand increases, additional nodes can be added to the cluster to handle more users or tenants efficiently.\\n\\n### Scalability\\n\\nTiDB's horizontal scalability is a key feature that enables it to support a large number of users. The process of scaling involves increasing or decreasing the number of nodes in a TiDB cluster to adjust its capacity. This flexibility is crucial for environments with fluctuating workloads, as it allows the system to maintain performance levels by scaling out (adding more nodes) or scaling in (removing nodes) as needed.\\n\\nIn terms of numerical benchmarks, TiDB has been tested in various performance scenarios. For instance, in a TPC-C workload, TiDB and TiKV were configured with 16 CPUs each, and the system was able to handle high CPU usage effectively. The average CPU usage for TiDB was 761%, with a maximum of 934%, while TiKV had an average of 1343% and a maximum of 1505% ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/performance-tuning-methods)). These figures demonstrate TiDB's capability to manage high loads, which is indicative of its ability to support a large number of concurrent users.\\n\\n### Resource Control\\n\\nTiDB's resource control features are designed to manage resource allocation and usage for different types of tasks and queries. This includes controlling queries that consume excessive resources and managing resource allocation for various tasks, including background tasks. The resource control feature allows for limiting or canceling resource-intensive queries, which helps in maintaining the performance of online applications.\\n\\nHowever, there is a potential performance overhead associated with resource control, especially in high concurrency or resource-intensive scenarios. The overhead comes from the need to monitor and manage resources actively, which can introduce some latency. Despite this, the benefits of preventing resource hogging and ensuring fair resource distribution often outweigh the potential downsides.\\n\\n### Performance Impact\\n\\nThe performance impact of resource control in TiDB can be both qualitative and quantitative. Qualitatively, resource control ensures that no single query or task can monopolize system resources, which helps in maintaining overall system stability and performance. Quantitatively, benchmarks have shown that TiDB can handle high CPU and memory usage efficiently, as demonstrated in various performance tests ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/performance-tuning-methods)).\\n\\nIn summary, TiDB's scalability and resource control features make it well-suited for environments with a large number of users or tenants. The system's ability to scale horizontally and manage resources effectively ensures that it can handle high loads and maintain performance levels, even in demanding scenarios. For more detailed insights, you can refer to the performance tuning methods and benchmarks available in the TiDB documentation ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/performance-tuning-methods)).\", 'reasoning': 'Okay, so I need to update the plan based on the user\\'s suggestions.

They also want the final answer to include both qualitative and quantitative insights, especially regarding performance overhead.\\n\\nLooking at the current plan, after step 2 (which retrieves documents on scalability and performance), the next step should be to search for numerical data. So, I\\'ll add a new step 3 that uses vector_search with a query focused on numerical limits and guidelines. This will help gather specific data points.\\n\\nThen, the final step (step 4) needs to be updated. The LLM prompt should now include the new data from step 3.

Let me start by understanding the current plan and the suggestions.\\n\\nThe original plan is designed to determine the default password for TiDB Dashboard. It involves three main steps: using retrieve_knowledge_graph to get information about the authentication mechanism, using vector_search to find detailed documentation, and then synthesizing the information with llm_generate to provide a final answer.\\n\\nThe suggestions mention adding a verification step to check the official documentation, modifying the vector search to include more terms, and enhancing the synthesis prompt to include citations. These changes aim to make the answer more accurate and authoritative.\\n\\nSo, first, I need to consider how to integrate these suggestions into the existing plan without disrupting the flow. Let me break down each suggestion:\\n\\n1. **Verification Step**: This suggests adding a step to explicitly check the official TiDB documentation. This makes sense because it ensures that any retrieved information is accurate and up-to-date. I\\'ll need to add a new calling step that uses vector_search with a query targeting the official documentation.\\n\\n2. **Modify Vector Search**: The suggestion is to expand the vector search query to include terms like \\'latest configuration\\' or \\'TiDB root authentication changes\\'. This should help retrieve more relevant and recent documents. I\\'ll update the existing vector_search tool_params to include these terms.\\n\\n3. **Enhance Synthesis Prompt**: The synthesis step should instruct the model to include official documentation links and citations. This improves the credibility of the answer. I\\'ll modify the llm_generate tool_params to include this instruction.\\n\\nNow, I need to structure these changes into the plan. The original plan has four steps (0 to 3). Starting from the current program counter (1), I\\'ll need to adjust the steps accordingly.\\n\\n- **Step 1**: Keep the retrieve_knowledge_graph as is.\\n- **Step 2**: Update the vector_search query to include the additional terms.\\n- **Step 3**: Add a new vector_search step targeting the official documentation.\\n- **Step 4**: Modify the llm_generate step to include the new information and the instruction to add citations.\\n\\nWait, but the current program counter is 1, meaning steps 0 and 1 have already been executed. So, I need to adjust the plan starting from step 1, ensuring that the new steps are added correctly.\\n\\nLet me outline the updated plan:\\n\\n1. Keep the initial reasoning step (seq_no 0).\\n2. Execute retrieve_knowledge_graph (seq_no 1).\\n3. Update vector_search to include broader terms (seq_no 2).\\n4. Add a new vector_search for official docs (seq_no 3).\\n5. Modify llm_generate to synthesize all information and include citations (seq_no 4).\\n\\nI also need to ensure that the output variables are correctly referenced. For example, the new vector_search for official docs should store its results in a new variable, say \"official_docs\".\\n\\nIn the llm_generate step, the context should include all gathered information: dashboard_auth_graph, dashboard_auth_docs, and official_docs. The prompt should instruct the model to check the official docs for default settings and include citations.\\n\\nI should also make sure that the final answer variable is correctly set to \"final_answer\" as per the specifications.\\n\\nAnother consideration is the order of steps. After retrieve_knowledge_graph, the vector_search steps can run independently, but the llm_generate step depends on all of them. So, the dependencies are correctly handled by executing the vector_search steps before the synthesis.\\n\\nI think that\\'s the main structure.

This operator is generally efficient for targeted queries but can be less efficient than a TableFullScan for queries returning large result sets.\\n\\n### Selection\\nThe Selection operator filters rows based on specified conditions, reducing the dataset to only those records that meet the criteria. This operator is crucial for optimizing query performance by narrowing down the result set before passing it to subsequent operations.\\n\\n### Index Range Scan\\nIndex Range Scan is used to efficiently retrieve rows based on a specified range of index values. It performs a range scan on an index, which is more efficient than a full index scan. This operation is often used in conjunction with Index Lookup to optimize queries that filter data based on indexed columns.\\n\\n### Limit\\nThe Limit operator restricts the number of rows returned in a query result set. It can be pushed down to TiKV or TiFlash for execution, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed and transferred.\\n\\n### Top-N\\nThe Top-N operator retrieves the top N rows of a result set based on specified ordering criteria. It combines sorting and limiting functionalities and can be pushed down to the storage layer to reduce data processing overhead.\\n\\n### Execution Plan Differences and Impact on Performance\\n\\n1. **Index Lookup vs. TableFullScan**: \\n   - Index Lookup is more efficient for queries that can leverage indexes to quickly locate relevant rows. It reduces the amount of data that needs to be scanned and processed.\\n   - TableFullScan, on the other hand, scans the entire table, which can be less efficient for large datasets.\\n\\n2. **Selection Optimization**:\\n   - The Selection operator helps in filtering out unnecessary data early in the execution plan, which can significantly improve performance by reducing the workload for subsequent operations.\\n\\n3. **Index Range Scan Efficiency**:\\n   - Using Index Range Scan instead of a full index scan can greatly enhance performance by focusing only on the relevant range of data, especially when combined with Index Lookup.\\n\\n4. **Limit and Top-N Pushdown**:\\n   - Pushing down Limit and Top-N operations to the storage layer (TiKV or TiFlash) can reduce the amount of data transferred to the TiDB layer, thus improving query performance by minimizing data processing and network overhead.\\n\\n5. **Top-N vs. Limit**:\\n   - While both operators limit the number of rows, Top-N also involves sorting, which can be more computationally intensive. However, when pushed down, it can still be efficient by reducing the data early in the execution process.\\n\\nIn summary, the execution plan that effectively utilizes Index Lookup, Index Range Scan, and pushes down Limit and Top-N operations to the storage layer will generally offer better performance by reducing data processing and transfer overhead. The Selection operator further optimizes performance by filtering data early in the execution plan.', 'reasoning': 'To compare the two execution plans in TiDB, we need to analyze the differences in their operations and task details. The goal is to understand how each plan executes the query and what makes them distinct. The key differences between the two plans are the presence of Top-N operations in Execution Plan 2 and the Limit operation in Execution Plan 1. Additionally, both plans involve Index Lookup, Selection, and Index Range Scan operations, but their configurations and task details may vary.\\n\\nTo achieve this goal, we will follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Problem Analysis and Hypothesis Generation**:\\n   - Identify the key components and operations in each execution plan.\\n   - Hypothesize the impact of these components on query execution.\\n\\n2. **Multi-Channel Information Gathering**:\\n   - Use the `retrieve_knowledge_graph` tool to gather structured information about TiDB execution plans, focusing on Index Lookup, Selection, Index Range Scan, Limit, and Top-N operations.\\n   - Use the `vector_search` tool to find relevant documentation or case studies that explain the differences between these operations.\\n\\n3. **Reasoning and Solution Generation**:\\n   - Use the `llm_generate` tool to synthesize the gathered information and provide a detailed comparison of the two execution plans.\\n   - Ensure the final answer is coherent and directly addresses the goal.\\n\\nThe plan will include reasoning steps to outline the thought process and dependencies, followed by tool calls to gather and synthesize information.

We will also highlight the impact of using a single Limit operation versus multiple Top-N operations.\\n\\n### 1. IndexLookup Operations\\n- **IndexLookup_31 vs. IndexLookUp_28**: \\n  - **IndexLookup_31**: This operation retrieves data using an index, which is efficient for queries that filter data based on indexed columns. It involves two phases: the Build phase, where RowIDs are collected using an index scan, and the Probe phase, where the actual data is fetched using these RowIDs.\\n  - **IndexLookUp_28**: Similar to IndexLookup_31, this operation also retrieves data using an index. The efficiency of this operation depends on the selectivity of the index and the number of rows that need to be fetched.\\n\\n### 2. Selection Operations\\n- **Selection_24 vs. Selection_21**:\\n  - **Selection_24**: This operator filters rows based on specified conditions, reducing the dataset to only those records that meet the criteria. It is crucial for optimizing query performance by narrowing down the result set before passing it to subsequent operations.\\n  - **Selection_21**: Similar to Selection_24, this operator also filters rows based on conditions. The efficiency of the Selection operation depends on the complexity of the conditions and the size of the dataset being filtered.\\n\\n### 3. Sorting and Pushdown Efficiency\\n- **TopN and Limit Operator Push Down**: \\n  - The TopN operator combines the functionality of sorting (ORDER BY) and limiting the result set (LIMIT). It is more efficient than separate Sort and Limit operations because it reduces the amount of data processed early in the execution plan.\\n  - **Pushdown Efficiency**: By pushing down TopN and Limit operators closer to the data source, TiDB reduces the overhead of data transmission and calculation. This is particularly beneficial when dealing with large datasets, as it minimizes the amount of data that needs to be transferred across the network.\\n\\n### 4. Network Overhead\\n- **Network Overhead**: The use of TopN and Limit pushdown significantly reduces network overhead by filtering data at the storage layer (e.g., TiKV) before it is sent to the TiDB layer. This reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted over the network, improving query performance.\\n\\n### 5. Single Limit vs. Multiple Top-N Operations\\n- **Single Limit Operation**: A single Limit operation is equivalent to a TopN operator with a null sorting rule. It restricts the number of rows returned in a query result set, which can be pushed down to TiKV or TiFlash for execution.\\n- **Multiple Top-N Operations**: When multiple TopN operations are used, they can be applied at different stages of the execution plan, allowing for more granular control over data sorting and limiting. This can lead to more efficient query execution, especially when combined with join operations.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nThe differences between the two execution plans, particularly in the use of IndexLookup, Selection, and TopN/Limit operations, have a significant impact on query performance. By optimizing the execution plan to push down operations closer to the data source and using TopN operators for sorting and limiting, TiDB can achieve more efficient query execution with reduced network overhead and improved performance.', 'reasoning': \"Alright, I need to figure out how to update the execution plan based on the user's suggestions.

This optimization is crucial for improving query performance, especially for large datasets.\\n\\n**Impact on Performance**: Pushing down TopN or Limit operators allows TiDB to filter data closer to the source, reducing the amount of data transferred over the network and processed by the database engine. This can significantly enhance performance, particularly in distributed environments.\\n\\n### 4. Network Overhead\\n- **Network Overhead**: By pushing down operations like TopN and Limit, TiDB reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred between TiKV and TiDB. This reduction in data transfer minimizes network overhead, leading to faster query execution times.\\n\\n### 5. Single Limit Operation vs. Multiple Top-N Operations\\n- **Single Limit Operation**: A single Limit operation restricts the number of rows returned by the query.

This approach can optimize performance by reducing the dataset size incrementally.\\n\\n**Impact on Performance**: While a single Limit operation is simpler, multiple Top-N operations can provide better performance in complex queries by leveraging sorting and limiting at various stages. This approach can lead to more efficient use of resources and faster query execution.\\n\\nIn summary, the differences in execution plans, particularly in the use of IndexLookup, Selection, and TopN/Limit operators, significantly impact query performance.

We'll also discuss the impact of these differences on query performance, including sorting behavior, pushdown efficiency, and network overhead, as well as the implications of using a single Limit operation versus multiple Top-N operations.\\n\\n### 1. IndexLookup_31 vs. IndexLookUp_28\\n- **IndexLookup_31** and **IndexLookUp_28** are both responsible for retrieving data using an index. The primary difference lies in their execution parameters, such as the range of index values they scan and the order in which they retrieve data.\\n- **Performance Impact**: The efficiency of these operations depends on the range of data they access. A narrower range can lead to faster execution as it reduces the amount of data processed. If IndexLookup_31 has a more optimized range or better index utilization, it could outperform IndexLookUp_28.\\n\\n### 2. Selection_24 vs. Selection_21\\n- **Selection_24** and **Selection_21** filter rows based on specific conditions. The key difference is the conditions they evaluate and their position in the execution plan.\\n- **Performance Impact**: The effectiveness of these selections depends on how early they can filter out non-matching rows. If Selection_24 can push down more conditions to the storage layer, it reduces the data volume earlier, improving performance compared to Selection_21.\\n\\n### 3. IndexRangeScan_22 vs. IndexRangeScan_19\\n- **IndexRangeScan_22** and **IndexRangeScan_19** perform range scans on indexes. The difference lies in the specific index ranges they cover and whether they maintain order.\\n- **Performance Impact**: An IndexRangeScan that covers a smaller, more targeted range can execute faster and with less resource consumption. If IndexRangeScan_22 is more selective or better aligned with the query's needs, it will be more efficient than IndexRangeScan_19.\\n\\n### 4. TableRowIDScan_23 vs. TableRowIDScan_20\\n- **TableRowIDScan_23** and **TableRowIDScan_20** retrieve full rows based on RowIDs obtained from the index scan. Differences may include the number of rows they access and the order of retrieval.\\n- **Performance Impact**: The efficiency of these scans is influenced by the number of RowIDs they process. A scan that processes fewer RowIDs or can leverage better caching will perform better.\\n\\n### Sorting Behavior and Pushdown Efficiency\\n- **Sorting**: The use of Top-N operators can significantly impact sorting behavior. If a Top-N operator is pushed down closer to the data source, it reduces the amount of data that needs to be sorted at higher levels, improving performance.\\n- **Pushdown Efficiency**: Operators like Top-N and Limit, when pushed down to the storage layer (e.g., TiKV), can reduce network overhead and improve query performance by minimizing the data transferred to the compute layer.\\n\\n### Network Overhead\\n- Reducing the amount of data transferred between TiKV and TiDB by pushing down operations like Top-N and Limit can significantly decrease network overhead, leading to faster query execution.\\n\\n### Single Limit vs. Multiple Top-N Operations\\n- **Single Limit**: A single Limit operation is straightforward but may not leverage the full potential of pushdown optimizations.\\n- **Multiple Top-N Operations**: Using multiple Top-N operations allows for more granular control over data filtering and sorting, potentially improving performance by reducing the data volume earlier in the execution plan.\\n\\n### Task Parameters: Partitioning, Concurrency, and Wait Times\\n- **Partitioning**: Efficient partitioning can lead to better data distribution and parallel processing, enhancing performance.\\n- **Concurrency**: Higher concurrency can improve throughput but may increase contention and resource usage.\\n- **Wait Times**: Reducing wait times through efficient scheduling and resource allocation can lead to faster query execution.\\n\\nIn summary, the differences in execution plans can significantly impact query performance. Optimizing index usage, selection conditions, and leveraging pushdown capabilities for Top-N and Limit operations are crucial for achieving efficient query execution in TiDB.\", 'reasoning': \"Okay, I need to update the execution plan based on the user's suggestions. Let me go through the problem step by step.\\n\\nFirst, the user wants a detailed comparison of two TiDB execution plans, focusing on specific operations and their parameters. The current plan has some steps, but the user suggests enhancing it to include more detailed comparisons, especially for IndexRangeScan and TableRowIDScan operators, and to better address task parameters like partitioning and concurrency.\\n\\nLooking at the current plan, after step 0 (reasoning), steps 1 to 5 involve retrieving knowledge, searching for differences, and generating a comparison. The user's suggestions aim to make this more comprehensive.\\n\\nI realize that the current plan doesn't explicitly retrieve examples or detailed documentation comparing the operator parameters beyond Limit and Top-N. So, adding a vector_search step to find specific examples for these operators would help. This will provide concrete instances where these operations are used, highlighting their differences.\\n\\nNext, the llm_generate prompt needs to be adjusted to ask for a more detailed comparison. The prompt should include all operations (IndexLookup, Selection, IndexRangeScan, TableRowIDScan, Top-N, Limit) and their parameters, as well as the impact on performance. This ensures the generated analysis is thorough.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that each new step is properly integrated into the plan without disrupting the existing flow. Each tool call should have the correct parameters and output variables to maintain referential integrity.\\n\\nI'll add a vector_search step (seq_no 3) to retrieve examples for IndexRangeScan and TableRowIDScan. Then, before generating the final comparison, I'll retrieve additional documentation on the nuances of these operators (seq_no 4). This ensures all necessary information is gathered before synthesizing the final answer.\\n\\nFinally, I'll modify the llm_generate prompt (seq_no 5) to include all these aspects, ensuring the analysis is comprehensive.\\n\\nSo, the updated plan will include these new steps and a revised prompt to cover all the user's suggestions.\", 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': 'To compare the two execution plans, we need to analyze the key operations involved: Index Lookup, Selection, Index Range Scan, Limit, and Top-N.

Let me start by understanding the current situation.\\n\\nThe user\\'s goal is to determine the time interval for TiDB Data Migration (DM) to write to disk. The current plan involves three steps: retrieving knowledge from the knowledge graph, performing a vector search for configuration snippets, and generating a response using an LLM. The user\\'s suggestions point out that the current plan doesn\\'t provide specific numerical values or default intervals for the disk write behavior and that the response might include unnecessary information.\\n\\nFirst, I need to address the lack of specific numerical data. The suggestion is to add a step that specifically looks for default values or intervals in the TiDB documentation. This could involve another vector search with a more targeted query, such as \"TiDB DM default disk write interval\" or \"TiDB DM checkpoint update frequency.\" This would help in extracting any existing default values.\\n\\nNext, the LLM prompt needs to be adjusted to clarify whether the write interval is user-configurable or determined by internal triggers. The current prompt doesn\\'t explicitly ask this, so modifying it to include this aspect would make the response more informative. Additionally, the prompt should ensure that the response is concise and focused solely on the disk write interval, avoiding any extraneous details.\\n\\nI should also consider whether the current vector search is sufficient. Since the initial vector search might not have retrieved specific enough information, adding another search with a more precise query could yield better results. Alternatively, I could modify the existing vector search to include additional terms that might uncover the necessary details.\\n\\nAnother consideration is ensuring that the output from the LLM is clean and free of any irrelevant information. This might involve refining the prompt to instruct the LLM to exclude any unnecessary data and focus strictly on the requested interval and configuration details.\\n\\nI also need to make sure that the plan remains efficient and doesn\\'t include redundant steps. Adding a new vector search step would increase the plan\\'s length, but it\\'s necessary to gather the required specific information. However, I should check if the existing vector search can be adjusted instead of adding a new step, to keep the plan as concise as possible.\\n\\nFinally, I must ensure that all changes align with the VM specifications, such as maintaining the correct instruction types, variable references, and output formats. The last instruction must assign the final answer to the \"final_answer\" variable, and all steps should follow the sequential execution without introducing any dependencies that could cause issues.\\n\\nIn summary, the key steps to update the plan are:\\n1. Add a new vector search step with a more targeted query to find specific default intervals.\\n2. Modify the LLM prompt to explicitly ask about the presence of default values and whether the interval is user-configurable.\\n3. Ensure the LLM response is focused and free of unnecessary information.\\n4.

This compatibility ensures that users familiar with MySQL can easily transition to using TiDB without needing to learn new syntax for basic operations like inserting data.\\n\\n### Optimization Strategies for INSERT Statements\\n\\n1. **Execution Plan Optimization**: TiDB uses an execution plan to determine the most efficient way to execute SQL statements, including `INSERT` operations. The execution plan is optimized based on statistics and can be influenced by various factors such as indexes and table structure. TiDB's optimizer considers different strategies to minimize resource usage and execution time.\\n\\n2. **Statistics and Index Usage**: TiDB relies on accurate statistics to optimize execution plans. For `INSERT` operations, maintaining up-to-date statistics is crucial as it helps the optimizer make informed decisions about how to handle data insertion efficiently. Indexes can also play a significant role in optimizing `INSERT` operations by reducing the time needed to locate the correct insertion point within a table.\\n\\n3. **Concurrency and Resource Management**: TiDB is designed to handle high concurrency, which is essential for efficiently processing multiple `INSERT` operations simultaneously. The system can adjust concurrency settings to optimize performance based on the workload and available resources.\\n\\n4. **Handling Duplicate Keys**: TiDB supports the `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` clause, which allows for handling duplicate key conflicts during `INSERT` operations. This feature can be used to update existing records when a duplicate key is encountered, thus optimizing the process by reducing the need for additional queries to check for duplicates.\\n\\n5. **Partitioning and Sharding**: For large datasets, TiDB can utilize partitioning and sharding strategies to distribute data across multiple nodes. This distribution helps in balancing the load and improving the performance of `INSERT` operations by reducing contention and allowing parallel processing.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on how TiDB handles `INSERT` statements and its optimization strategies, you can refer to the official documentation: [TiDB SQL Statement Reference for INSERT](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.2/sql-statement-insert).\", 'reasoning': 'To address the goal of analyzing or obtaining the execution plan for an INSERT statement in TiDB, we need to follow a structured approach.

The `EXPLAIN` command can help understand how TiDB plans to execute the `INSERT` operation, but it does not execute the statement itself.\\n\\nFor more detailed execution insights, especially when diagnosing performance issues, you can use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`. This command executes the statement and provides runtime statistics, which can be useful for understanding the actual performance characteristics of the query. However, note that `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` will execute the `INSERT` statement, meaning it will modify the data.\\n\\n### Optimization Strategies and Limitations\\n\\nTiDB optimizes `INSERT` operations by using various strategies, such as batching multiple rows in a single transaction to reduce overhead. However, unlike `SELECT` queries, where complex execution plans can be optimized by reordering joins or using indexes, `INSERT` operations are more about efficiently writing data to storage.\\n\\n### Diagnosing INSERT Performance Issues\\n\\nTo diagnose performance issues with `INSERT` statements, you can:\\n\\n1. **Analyze Slow Logs**: TiDB logs slow queries, including `INSERT` operations, which can help identify performance bottlenecks. You can review these logs to see if certain `INSERT` operations are taking longer than expected.\\n\\n2. **Use Performance Metrics**: Tools like Grafana can be used to monitor TiDB's performance metrics, such as write latency and throughput. These metrics can provide insights into how well the database is handling `INSERT` operations.\\n\\n3. **Update Statistics**: Ensure that table statistics are up-to-date by running `ANALYZE TABLE`. Accurate statistics help TiDB optimize query execution plans, which can indirectly affect the performance of `INSERT` operations if they involve subqueries or conditions.\\n\\n4. **Adjust System Variables**: If you identify that concurrency or resource limits are affecting performance, consider adjusting relevant system variables to optimize resource usage.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on using `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` in TiDB, you can refer to the official documentation: [EXPLAIN ANALYZE | TiDB SQL Statement Reference](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.2/sql-statement-explain-analyze).\", 'reasoning': \"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to update the plan based on the user's suggestions.

Here’s a comprehensive approach to effectively manage and optimize safepoint generation:\\n\\n### Understanding the Issue\\n\\n1. **Safepoint Role**: Safepoints are critical timestamps that determine the point in time before which data can be safely deleted. They ensure that no data required for ongoing transactions or backups is removed prematurely.\\n\\n2. **Impact of Multiple Safepoints**: Frequent generation of safepoints can lead to performance degradation during backup operations, as it may cause unnecessary delays and resource consumption.\\n\\n### Addressing the Issue\\n\\n1. **Review GC Configuration**: \\n   - Ensure that the `tikv_gc_safe_point` is correctly configured to prevent premature data deletion. This involves setting an appropriate GC interval and duration that aligns with your backup schedule.\\n   - For large data exports or when Dumpling cannot connect directly to PD, manually extend the GC time to avoid export failures.\\n\\n2. **Optimize Backup Configuration**:\\n   - Adjust BR backup configurations such as `num-threads`, `batch-size`, and `sst-max-size` to optimize resource utilization and improve performance.\\n   - Enable the auto-tune feature (available from TiDB v5.4.0) to dynamically adjust resource usage based on the cluster's workload, reducing the impact on online operations.\\n\\n3. **Monitor and Tune Performance**:\\n   - Regularly monitor metrics such as CPU utilization, I/O usage, and backup throughput to identify bottlenecks.\\n   - Increase the `--concurrency` value if resource usage is not a bottleneck, to enhance backup performance.\\n\\n4. **Leverage New Features**:\\n   - Utilize the flashback feature (introduced in TiDB v6.4.0) for quick data recovery to a specified point in time within the GC time, which can be useful for recovering data after misoperations.\\n   - Implement Checkpoint Backup (improved in TiDB v6.5.0) to handle recoverable errors like disk exhaustion or node crashes, ensuring more reliable backup operations.\\n\\n5. **Ensure Consistent Safepoint Management**:\\n   - Coordinate with TiCDC and PD services to ensure that the safepoint is consistently managed across all components, preventing data required for replication from being prematurely deleted.\\n\\nBy implementing these strategies, you can effectively manage safepoint generation, optimize backup tasks, and ensure consistent and efficient data protection in TiDB.

For instance, TiDB version 6.5.11 addresses specific issues related to safepoint management, such as clearing safepoints in PD after a failed BR log backup PITR task. Regular updates can resolve known issues and improve system stability.\\n\\n2. **Adjust GC Lifetime**: Configure the `tidb_gc_life_time` system variable to ensure that the GC process does not interfere with long-running transactions or backup operations. This is crucial for maintaining data integrity during extensive data export or backup tasks.\\n\\n3. **Monitor and Adjust Safepoints**: Regularly monitor the safepoints in PD and ensure they are correctly set and cleared after backup tasks. This can prevent resource locking and ensure smooth operation of subsequent tasks.\\n\\n4. **Use BR Tool Features**: Leverage the Backup and Restore (BR) tool for efficient backup operations. It supports automatic GC time adjustment during backup and can handle both full and incremental backups. Utilize features like checkpoint backup to resume interrupted backups without starting from scratch.\\n\\n5. **Diagnostic Checks**: Perform additional diagnostic checks on PD logs, TiKV GC logs, and monitoring dashboards to identify any anomalies or issues in safepoint management. This can help in pinpointing the root cause of multiple safepoints and addressing them effectively.\\n\\n6. **Performance Tuning**: Monitor key metrics such as CPU and I/O utilization during backup operations to identify bottlenecks. Adjust parameters like concurrency to optimize performance, especially in environments with heavy workloads.\\n\\n### Best Practices\\n\\n- **Scheduled Backups**: Implement a scheduled snapshot backup policy using a custom `BackupSchedule` CR object to trigger regular backups at specified intervals.

**性能提升**：PD微服务模式通过将时间戳分配（TSO）和集群调度功能拆分为独立的微服务，解决了PD的性能瓶颈问题。这种拆分使得在大规模集群中，PD能够更高效地处理请求，减少长尾延迟和抖动现象，并降低调度模块故障导致的服务不可用风险。\\n\\n2. **高可用性和可靠性**：每个微服务作为独立进程运行，并支持主从容错模式。这种设计提高了服务的高可用性和可靠性，确保即使某个微服务出现问题，其他服务仍能正常运行。\\n\\n3. **灵活性和可扩展性**：调度模块可以独立更新，无需重启整个PD集群，这样的灵活性避免了对集群整体服务的影响。此外，调度微服务支持动态切换，即使调度微服务进程终止，PD仍能继续提供调度服务。\\n\\n4. **工具兼容性**：微服务模式不影响数据导入、导出和其他复制工具的正常使用，确保了与现有工具的兼容性。\\n\\n### 挑战\\n\\n1. **实验性质**：PD微服务模式目前仍处于实验阶段，不建议在生产环境中使用，因为该功能可能会在没有事先通知的情况下更改或移除。更多信息可以参考[PD微服务文档](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.3/pd-microservices)。\\n\\n2. **动态操作限制**：`tso`微服务不支持动态启动和停止，启用或禁用后需要重启PD集群才能生效。这限制了在运行时对服务进行灵活调整的能力。\\n\\n3. **兼容性问题**：微服务模式与某些功能不兼容，例如数据复制自动同步（DR Auto-Sync）和TiDB系统变量`tidb_enable_tso_follower_proxy`，这可能会限制某些功能的使用。\\n\\n4.

The actual length in characters depends on the character set used. For example, with the 'ascii' and 'latin1' character sets, the maximum length is 65,535 characters, while for 'utf8' it is 21,845 characters, and for 'utf8mb4' it is 16,383 characters.\\n- **Use Case**: `VARCHAR` is often used for columns where the maximum length of the data is known and is not expected to exceed the limit. It is also commonly used as a primary key type in certain database configurations.\\n- **Performance**: `VARCHAR` is generally more efficient in terms of storage and retrieval when the data length is predictable and relatively short.\\n\\n### `TEXT`:\\n- **Length and Storage**: `TEXT` can store up to 65,535 bytes. It is designed to handle larger text data compared to `VARCHAR`. The optional M argument in `TEXT` is specified in characters and can be used for automatic type selection, but this feature is not recommended.\\n- **Use Case**: `TEXT` is suitable for columns where the data length is variable and can be large, such as descriptions or comments.\\n- **Performance**: `TEXT` might be less efficient than `VARCHAR` for shorter strings due to its larger storage overhead and potential performance implications in certain operations.\\n\\n### Key Differences:\\n- **Storage Efficiency**: `VARCHAR` is more storage-efficient for shorter strings, while `TEXT` is better suited for larger text data.\\n- **Use Cases**: `VARCHAR` is ideal for known, shorter lengths, whereas `TEXT` is used for larger, variable-length text.\\n- **Performance**: `VARCHAR` can offer better performance for shorter strings, while `TEXT` is optimized for handling larger text data.\\n\\nIn summary, the choice between `VARCHAR` and `TEXT` in TiDB depends on the specific requirements of the data being stored, including the expected size and variability of the text data.\", 'reasoning': \"To address the goal of comparing the use of `VARCHAR(10000)` versus `TEXT` for storing long strings in TiDB, we need to focus on several key aspects: performance, storage, and use case recommendations.

Here's a detailed analysis:\\n\\n### Performance\\n- **VARCHAR**: Generally, `VARCHAR` is more efficient for operations that involve sorting and indexing because it is treated as a string type. It can be indexed, which can improve query performance when searching or sorting by this column.\\n- **TEXT**: `TEXT` is designed for storing large amounts of text data. It is less efficient for indexing and sorting operations compared to `VARCHAR`. Operations on `TEXT` fields can be slower because they are stored off the main table row, requiring additional I/O operations.\\n\\n### Storage Efficiency\\n- **VARCHAR**: The storage size of a `VARCHAR` field is the actual length of the string plus one or two bytes for length information. This makes `VARCHAR` more storage-efficient for shorter strings.\\n- **TEXT**: `TEXT` fields can store up to 65,535 bytes, but they are stored separately from the main table row, which can lead to additional storage overhead.\\n\\n### Indexing Behavior\\n- **VARCHAR**: Supports indexing, which can significantly improve the performance of queries that filter or sort by this column.\\n- **TEXT**: While `TEXT` can be indexed, it is less common due to performance considerations. Indexing large `TEXT` fields can lead to increased storage requirements and slower index operations.\\n\\n### Memory Overhead\\n- **VARCHAR**: Has lower memory overhead compared to `TEXT` because it is stored inline with the table row.\\n- **TEXT**: Has higher memory overhead due to its storage mechanism, which involves storing the data separately from the main table row.\\n\\n### Limitations\\n- **VARCHAR**: The maximum size is determined by the character set and the maximum row size, with a hard limit of 65,535 bytes. For example, with `utf8mb4`, the maximum length is 16,383 characters.\\n- **TEXT**: Can store up to 65,535 bytes, but the effective maximum size is limited by the maximum row size in TiDB, which is 6 MiB by default and can be increased to 120 MiB.\\n\\n### Use Case Recommendations\\n- **VARCHAR**: Recommended for fields that require indexing and are expected to contain variable-length strings that are not excessively large. Suitable for fields like names, titles, or short descriptions.\\n- **TEXT**: Recommended for storing large text data that does not require frequent indexing, such as comments, articles, or logs.\\n\\n### Recommendation\\nFor storing long strings in TiDB, if the strings are expected to be frequently indexed or sorted, `VARCHAR` is more suitable due to its better performance with indexing. However, if the primary requirement is to store large amounts of text data without the need for frequent indexing, `TEXT` is more appropriate due to its capacity to handle larger data sizes.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the choice between `VARCHAR(10000)` and `TEXT` should be based on the specific use case requirements, considering the need for indexing, the expected size of the data, and the performance implications.\", 'reasoning': 'Okay, so I need to update the plan based on the suggestions provided.

Current Configuration and Change Procedure:\\nIn a TiDB cluster, the timezone configuration is typically managed through the cluster's configuration settings. The timezone setting can affect how timestamps are stored and retrieved, which is crucial for applications that rely on accurate time data.\\n\\nTo view the current configuration of a TiDB instance, including the timezone setting, you can use the `show config` SQL statement. This command will display the configuration details for all instances in the cluster. You can filter the results to focus on specific configurations, such as those related to the timezone.\\n\\nIf you need to change the timezone configuration in a TiDB cluster, you can do so dynamically without restarting the cluster components. This is achieved by using SQL statements to update the configuration settings. The process involves:\\n\\n1. **Viewing Current Configuration**: Use the `show config` command to check the current timezone setting.\\n   ```sql\\n   show config where name like '%timezone%';\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Modifying Configuration**: To change the timezone, you would typically use a SQL statement to update the configuration. The exact command can vary based on the version and specific setup of your TiDB cluster.\\n\\n3. **Applying Changes**: Once the configuration is updated, the changes take effect immediately without needing to restart the cluster components.\\n\\nFor more detailed instructions on modifying configurations dynamically in a TiDB cluster, you can refer to the official documentation provided by PingCAP. Here is a useful link for further reading: [Modify Configuration Dynamically](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.1/dynamic-config).\\n\\nThis process ensures that your TiDB cluster operates with the correct timezone settings, which is essential for maintaining data consistency and accuracy across different geographical locations.\\n\\n2. Making the Change Permanent:\\nTo make timezone changes permanent in TiDB configuration files, you need to modify the system variables related to the scheduling of TTL (Time to Live) jobs. TiDB allows you to specify a time window during which TTL jobs can be scheduled. This is done by setting the global variables `tidb_ttl_job_schedule_window_start_time` and `tidb_ttl_job_schedule_window_end_time`. These variables define the start and end times of the window in which TTL jobs are allowed to run.\\n\\nTo set these variables, you can use the following SQL commands:\\n\\n```sql\\nSET @@global.tidb_ttl_job_schedule_window_start_time = '01:00 +0000';\\nSET @@global.tidb_ttl_job_schedule_window_end_time = '05:00 +0000';\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, TTL jobs are scheduled to run only between 1:00 and 5:00 UTC. By default, the time window is set to allow scheduling at any time, from `00:00 +0000` to `23:59 +0000`.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the official TiDB documentation on TTL jobs at the following link: [TiDB TTL Documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.1/time-to-live).\", 'reasoning': \"To address the goal of determining the safety and procedure for changing the timezone setting in a TiDB cluster, as well as making this change permanent in the configuration files, we need to break down the task into several steps:\\n\\n1. **Understand the Current Configuration**: We need to understand how the timezone is currently configured in a TiDB cluster. This involves retrieving information about the current timezone settings and how they are managed.\\n\\n2. **Assess the Safety of Changing Timezone on the Fly**: We need to determine if changing the timezone on the fly is safe and what potential impacts it might have on the cluster's operations.\\n\\n3. **Procedure for Changing Timezone**: We need to find the correct procedure to change the timezone setting in a TiDB cluster, including any necessary commands or configuration changes.\\n\\n4. **Make the Change Permanent**: We need to understand how to make the timezone change permanent by updating the configuration files.\\n\\n5. **Summarize the Findings**: Finally, we need to compile the information into a coherent plan that addresses both the immediate change and the permanent configuration aspects.\\n\\nTo achieve this, we will use the available tools to gather information and synthesize it into a final answer.

Current Configuration and Change Procedure:\\nIn a TiDB cluster, the timezone configuration can be managed using SQL commands. The timezone setting is crucial as it affects how date and time values are interpreted and displayed within the database.\\n\\nTo change the timezone configuration in a TiDB cluster, you can use the `SET GLOBAL time_zone` command. This command allows you to set the global timezone for the entire cluster. However, it\\'s important to note that changes made using this command will only apply to new sessions that are established after the change. Existing sessions will continue to use the timezone setting that was in effect when they were initiated.\\n\\nHere is a step-by-step procedure to change the timezone:\\n\\n1. **Connect to the TiDB Server**: Use a MySQL client or any other SQL client that can connect to the TiDB server.\\n\\n2. **Set the Global Timezone**: Execute the following SQL command to set the global timezone. Replace `\\'timezone\\'` with the desired timezone value, such as `\\'+00:00\\'` for UTC or `\\'Asia/Shanghai\\'` for a specific region.\\n\\n   ```sql\\n   SET GLOBAL time_zone = \\'timezone\\';\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Verify the Change**: To ensure that the timezone has been set correctly, you can check the current global timezone setting with the following command:\\n\\n   ```sql\\n   SHOW VARIABLES LIKE \\'time_zone\\';\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Restart Sessions**: Remember that the new timezone setting will only affect sessions that are started after the change. Existing sessions will not be affected until they are restarted.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on modifying configuration dynamically in a TiDB cluster, you can refer to the official documentation: [Modify Configuration Dynamically](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.1/dynamic-config).\\n\\n2. Making the Change Permanent:\\nTo make timezone changes permanent in TiDB, you need to modify the configuration files, specifically the `tidb.toml` file. The parameter you need to adjust is either `timezone` or `time-zone`. This parameter allows you to set the desired timezone for your TiDB server.\\n\\nHere’s how you can do it:\\n\\n1. **Edit the `tidb.toml` File**: Locate the `tidb.toml` configuration file on your server. Open this file in a text editor and find the `timezone` or `time-zone` parameter. Set this parameter to your desired timezone. For example, to set the timezone to UTC, you would add or modify the line to read:\\n   ```toml\\n   timezone = \"UTC\"\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Rolling Restart Using TiUP**: After making changes to the `tidb.toml` file, you need to apply these changes by performing a rolling restart of your TiDB cluster. This can be done using TiUP, which is a cluster management tool for TiDB. A rolling restart ensures that the changes are applied without significant downtime. Here’s a basic command to perform a rolling restart:\\n   ```bash\\n   tiup cluster restart <cluster-name> --role tidb\\n   ```\\n   Replace `<cluster-name>` with the name of your TiDB cluster.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that the timezone settings are permanently applied to your TiDB server configuration. For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the official TiDB documentation available at [PingCAP TiDB Documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable).\\n\\n3. Ensuring All Nodes Pick Up the Setting:\\nTo perform a rolling restart of a TiDB cluster using TiUP to ensure all nodes pick up the permanent timezone setting, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Prepare the Environment**: Before starting the rolling restart, ensure that your environment meets the necessary prerequisites. This includes verifying hardware and software requirements and checking the environment and system configuration. You can find detailed guidelines in the [Hardware and software requirements](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/hardware-and-software-requirements) and [Environment and system configuration check](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/check-before-deployment) documents.\\n\\n2. **Update the Configuration**: Modify the configuration file to set the desired timezone. This configuration change should be applied to all nodes in the cluster.\\n\\n3. **Perform a Rolling Restart**:\\n   - Use TiUP to restart each component of the TiDB cluster one by one. This ensures that the cluster remains available during the restart process.\\n   - Start with the TiKV nodes, followed by the TiDB nodes, and finally the PD nodes. This order helps maintain the stability and availability of the cluster.\\n   - For each node, execute the following command using TiUP:\\n     ```bash\\n     tiup cluster restart <cluster-name> --node <node-id>\\n     ```\\n   - Replace `<cluster-name>` with the name of your TiDB cluster and `<node-id>` with the identifier of the node you are restarting.\\n\\n4. **Verify the Changes**: After the rolling restart, verify that the timezone setting has been applied to all nodes. You can check the logs or use SQL queries to confirm that the timezone is correctly set.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that all nodes in your TiDB cluster pick up the permanent timezone setting without causing downtime.

This process is known as a rolling restart.\\n   - After restarting a node, verify that it has picked up the new timezone setting before proceeding to the next node.\\n\\n4. **Verify Changes**: After completing the rolling restart, check the logs and status of each node to confirm that the timezone setting has been applied successfully.\\n\\nFor more detailed instructions on deploying and managing a TiDB cluster using TiUP, you can refer to the official documentation: [Deploy a TiDB Cluster Using TiUP](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/production-deployment-using-tiup).', 'reasoning': \"Alright, so I need to figure out how to update the plan based on the user's suggestions. Let me start by understanding the current plan and the goal.\\n\\nThe goal is to determine if it's safe to change the timezone of a TiDB cluster on the fly and how to make this change permanent in the configuration files. The current plan has four steps, starting with a vector search to gather information about the current timezone configuration and the procedure to change it. Then, it uses llm_generate to explain the procedure. The next steps do a similar process for making the change permanent.\\n\\nThe suggestions point out a few areas for improvement. First, the plan should explicitly retrieve the correct configuration parameter, like 'timezone' or 'time-zone' in the TiDB configuration file, such as tidb.toml. Second, the dynamic change instructions should mention using SQL commands like SET GLOBAL time_zone and note that changes apply to new sessions. Third, the vector search should target 'TiDB permanent timezone configuration' to get reliable references. Additionally, the llm_generate steps should use this context for detailed guidance. Lastly, the answer should mention using TiUP for a rolling restart to ensure all nodes pick up the setting.\\n\\nLooking at the current plan, the vector_search queries are too generic.

This compatibility offers several benefits, but also presents some challenges that need to be addressed during migration.\\n\\n### Compatibility Features\\n\\nTiDB is highly compatible with the MySQL 5.7 protocol, supporting common features and syntax. This compatibility allows for the use of MySQL ecosystem tools such as PHPMyAdmin, Navicat, MySQL Workbench, mysqldump, and Mydumper/myloader with TiDB. This means that applications built on MySQL 5.7 can often be migrated to TiDB with minimal changes, leveraging existing tools and workflows. However, some MySQL features are not supported in TiDB, such as stored procedures, triggers, and certain data types like `FLOAT4/FLOAT8` and `SQL_TSI_*`. These differences need to be considered during migration planning.\\n\\n### Migration Benefits\\n\\nMigrating to TiDB can offer several benefits, particularly for applications that require scalability and distributed database capabilities. TiDB's architecture is designed to handle large-scale data and high concurrency, which can be advantageous for applications experiencing rapid growth or requiring high availability. Additionally, TiDB supports most SQL modes and provides a robust platform for applications that need to scale horizontally.\\n\\n### Potential Challenges\\n\\nDespite the compatibility, there are challenges in migrating from MySQL to TiDB. Some MySQL features are not supported or behave differently in TiDB. For example, TiDB does not support the MySQL replication protocol, but provides specific tools like TiDB Data Migration (DM) for data replication. Additionally, certain SQL syntax and modes have minor differences, which might require adjustments in application code. The lack of support for some MySQL-specific features, such as `FOREIGN KEY` constraints and certain character sets, may also necessitate changes in database design or application logic.\\n\\nMoreover, migrating data from TiDB back to MySQL-compatible databases, such as Aurora or MariaDB, involves setting up the environment, migrating full and incremental data, and ensuring service continuity. This process can be complex and requires careful planning and execution to avoid data loss or service disruption.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on TiDB's compatibility with MySQL and the migration process, you can refer to the following sources:\\n- [MySQL Compatibility](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v5.3/mysql-compatibility)\\n- [Migrate Data from TiDB to MySQL-compatible Databases](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.3/migrate-from-tidb-to-mysql)\", 'reasoning': \"To address the goal of understanding how TiDB's compatibility with the MySQL 5.7 protocol impacts the migration process for existing MySQL applications, we need to break down the task into several sub-goals.

This compatibility ensures that many MySQL applications can be migrated to TiDB without requiring changes to the application code, as TiDB supports the MySQL protocol and common features and syntax of MySQL 5.7. This includes compatibility with ecosystem tools like PHPMyAdmin, Navicat, and MySQL Workbench, which can be used seamlessly with TiDB [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v5.3/mysql-compatibility).\\n\\n### Compatibility Features\\nTiDB's compatibility with MySQL 5.7 includes support for the MySQL protocol, which allows applications to connect to TiDB using MySQL clients and drivers without modification. This compatibility extends to many MySQL features and syntax, making the transition smoother for developers familiar with MySQL. TiDB also supports MySQL's ecosystem tools, which means that existing workflows and tools can continue to be used post-migration.\\n\\n### Migration Benefits\\nThe primary benefit of this compatibility is the reduced need for code changes, which minimizes the risk and effort involved in migration. Applications can often be moved to TiDB with little to no modification, allowing organizations to leverage TiDB's distributed architecture and scalability without a significant overhaul of their existing systems. Additionally, TiDB's support for high availability and strong consistency provides a robust platform for applications that require these features [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/overview).\\n\\n### Potential Challenges\\nDespite the high level of compatibility, there are some MySQL features that TiDB does not support, such as stored procedures, triggers, and certain data types like `SPATIAL` and `FULLTEXT` indexes. These limitations may require workarounds or adjustments in applications that rely heavily on these features. Additionally, differences in SQL modes and default settings between MySQL and TiDB might necessitate some configuration changes to ensure consistent behavior [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v5.3/mysql-compatibility).\\n\\n### Insights from Knowledge Graph\\nThe knowledge graph highlights TiDB's design as a distributed SQL database that is MySQL-compatible, supporting large-scale data with high availability and strong consistency. This design is particularly beneficial for applications that need to scale horizontally or require robust failover capabilities. TiDB's architecture, which separates computing from storage, allows for flexible scaling and resource management, making it an attractive option for organizations looking to modernize their database infrastructure while maintaining compatibility with existing MySQL applications.\\n\\nIn summary, TiDB's compatibility with the MySQL 5.7 protocol offers significant advantages for migrating existing MySQL applications, though some challenges may arise due to unsupported features. Organizations can benefit from TiDB's scalability and high availability, making it a compelling choice for modern database needs.

For more details, you can refer to the [MySQL Compatibility documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v5.3/mysql-compatibility).\\n\\n### Migration Benefits\\nThe primary benefit of migrating to TiDB is its ability to handle Hybrid Transactional and Analytical Processing (HTAP) workloads, which is not typically possible with traditional MySQL databases. TiDB's architecture supports horizontal scalability, strong consistency, and high availability, making it suitable for large-scale applications that require robust performance and reliability. Additionally, TiDB's compatibility with MySQL means that existing applications can leverage these advanced features without significant redevelopment. More information on TiDB's features can be found in the [TiDB Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/overview).\\n\\n### Potential Challenges\\nDespite the high level of compatibility, there are some challenges to consider. TiDB does not support certain MySQL features, such as stored procedures, triggers, and certain data types like `FULLTEXT` and `SPATIAL` indexes. These limitations may require developers to modify their applications to work around unsupported features. Additionally, differences in SQL modes and default settings between MySQL and TiDB can lead to unexpected behaviors if not properly managed during migration. For instance, TiDB's default character set is `utf8mb4`, whereas MySQL 5.7 defaults to `latin1`, which could affect data handling and storage. These differences are detailed in the [MySQL Compatibility documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v5.3/mysql-compatibility).\\n\\nIn summary, while TiDB offers a high degree of compatibility with MySQL 5.7, facilitating a relatively smooth migration process, it is important for developers to be aware of the specific differences and limitations that may impact their applications.

Here are some potential issues and suggestions for corrections:\\n\\n1. **AUTO_RANDOM Usage**:\\n   - Ensure that the `AUTO_RANDOM` attribute is only used with `BIGINT` or `UNSIGNED BIGINT` columns. This is a requirement to avoid issues with allocatable space being consumed too quickly.\\n   - The `AUTO_RANDOM` attribute should be used to mitigate write hotspots by distributing writes across storage nodes. It is typically used as an alternative to `AUTO_INCREMENT` for primary key columns.\\n   - If you are using `AUTO_RANDOM`, make sure to define the shard bits appropriately. The best practice is to set the shard bits as `log(2, x)`, where `x` is the number of storage engines. This helps in evenly distributing the load across nodes.\\n\\n2. **Partitioning**:\\n   - TiDB supports several types of partitioning, including `HASH`, `RANGE`, `LIST`, and `KEY`. Ensure that the partitioning type used is supported and correctly implemented.\\n   - For `HASH` partitioning, ensure that the partitioning expression returns an integer, and specify the number of partitions using the `PARTITIONS num` clause.\\n   - If using `RANGE` partitioning, ensure that the ranges are contiguous and non-overlapping. Use `VALUES LESS THAN` to define the range boundaries.\\n   - Avoid using unsupported partition operations like `SUBPARTITION` or operations such as `CHECK`, `OPTIMIZE`, `REPAIR`, `IMPORT`, `DISCARD`, and `REBUILD` on partitions.\\n\\n3. **General Syntax and Best Practices**:\\n   - Ensure that all column definitions and constraints are correctly specified according to TiDB's syntax rules.\\n   - Use the `SHOW CREATE TABLE` statement to verify the table's definition and ensure that all attributes, such as `AUTO_RANDOM`, are correctly applied.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on these features and their correct usage, you can refer to the following sources:\\n- [AUTO_RANDOM Documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/auto-random)\\n- [Partitioning in TiDB](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/partitioned-table)\\n\\nBy following these guidelines, you can ensure that your TiDB table definition adheres to the correct syntax and best practices, minimizing potential issues.\", 'reasoning': \"To address the goal of identifying syntax issues in the provided TiDB table definition, we need to follow a structured approach.

Here is a comprehensive guide based on the knowledge graph and vector search findings:\\n\\n### Understanding DDL Execution in TiDB\\n\\n1. **DDL Execution Framework**: \\n   - Before TiDB v6.2.0, DDL statements were allocated to two first-in-first-out queues: Reorg DDLs and General DDLs. This could lead to blocking if multiple DDL statements were executed simultaneously, especially if they operated on the same table.\\n   - From TiDB v6.2.0 onwards, a concurrent framework was introduced, eliminating the first-in-first-out queue limitation. This allows TiDB to execute DDL tasks concurrently, significantly improving the execution speed of DDL operations.\\n\\n2. **Factors Affecting DDL Execution Speed**:\\n   - **Concurrency Limits**: Even with the concurrent framework, there are limits to the number of concurrent DDL operations to prevent excessive resource consumption.\\n   - **DDL Owner Node**: The DDL Owner node is responsible for executing DDL operations. If the owner node is not functioning correctly, it can cause delays.\\n   - **Schema Version Updates**: DDL operations require schema version updates across all TiDB nodes. Delays in these updates can slow down DDL execution.\\n\\n3. **Common Causes of Slow DDL Execution**:\\n   - **Non-Auto-Commit DML Statements**: If there are uncommitted DML statements before a DDL operation, it can cause delays as TiDB commits these statements first.\\n   - **Queuing of DDL Statements**: Multiple DDL statements executed together may need to wait in a queue, especially if they are of the same type or have dependencies.\\n   - **Network Issues**: Communication problems between TiDB nodes and PD or TiKV can delay schema version updates.\\n\\n### Troubleshooting Steps\\n\\n1. **Identify the DDL Owner Node**:\\n   - Use `curl http://{TiDBIP}:10080/info/all` to identify the current DDL Owner node.\\n   - Check the monitoring dashboard under **DDL** > **DDL META OPM** to view the owner during specific time periods.\\n\\n2. **Check for Blocked DDL Execution**:\\n   - Ensure that the DDL Owner node is functioning correctly. If not, manually trigger an owner election using `curl -X POST http://{TiDBIP}:10080/ddl/owner/resign`.\\n   - Export the Goroutine stack to identify potential stuck locations.\\n\\n3. **Optimize DDL Execution**:\\n   - **Parallel DDL Execution**: Ensure that your TiDB version supports parallel DDL execution and that the concurrency settings are optimized.\\n   - **Network Health**: Verify the network health between TiDB, PD, and TiKV nodes to ensure timely schema updates.\\n   - **Resource Allocation**: Check the resource allocation for TiDB nodes to ensure they have sufficient CPU and memory for DDL operations.\\n\\n4. **Review Partitioning Strategy**:\\n   - **Dynamic Partition Pruning**: Utilize dynamic partition pruning to optimize query performance by eliminating unnecessary partitions.\\n   - **Partition Types**: Choose the appropriate partitioning type (e.g., RANGE, LIST, HASH) based on your use case to improve performance and manageability.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can effectively troubleshoot and optimize slow DDL execution when adding partitions in TiDB.

Ensure that your system has adequate CPU, memory, and I/O resources. Monitor these resources using TiDB's monitoring tools to identify and alleviate bottlenecks.\\n\\n2. **Concurrency Limits**: While concurrency limits are necessary to prevent resource overuse, they can also slow down DDL execution.

Conduct network diagnostics to ensure connectivity and address any latency issues that might be affecting performance.\\n\\n4. **DDL Owner Election**: Delays in DDL operations can occur due to the DDL owner election process, especially after a cluster restart. Regularly check and manage the DDL owner to minimize these delays.\\n\\n5. **Schema Changes and Dependencies**: The need for serial execution of DDL operations on the same table can be a bottleneck. Plan and schedule DDL tasks carefully to avoid conflicts and ensure smooth execution.\\n\\n6. **Monitor DDL Execution**: Use the TiDB monitoring dashboard to track DDL operations and identify any anomalies or delays in real-time.\\n\\n7. **Analyze Logs**: Regularly review TiDB logs for any errors or warnings that could indicate underlying issues affecting DDL performance.\\n\\nFor the most current practices and detailed guidance, refer to the official TiDB documentation and community resources.

Let me start by understanding what\\'s currently in the plan and what the suggestions are for improvement.\\n\\nThe current plan is structured with several steps. It begins with an assign instruction setting the goal, followed by retrieve_knowledge_graph and vector_search calls to gather information. Then, it uses llm_generate to create a troubleshooting guide and assigns that as the final answer.\\n\\nThe suggestions mention adding a step to verify the accuracy and relevance of the retrieved information. They also suggest prioritizing the identified issues based on their impact. This makes sense because sometimes the information gathered might not be entirely accurate or relevant, especially if the knowledge graph or vector search retrieves outdated or tangentially related data.\\n\\nSo, the first thing I need to do is add a verification step. This could involve another LLM call to cross-check the data against the latest TiDB documentation or community best practices.

Then, I can add a conditional jmp instruction that checks if verification is needed. If it is, the plan jumps to a new step where another llm_generate call verifies the information. This step would take the existing knowledge graph and vector search results, cross-reference them, and produce a verified guide.\\n\\nAfter verification, I add another assign instruction to set \"prioritization_needed\" to true.

This step uses llm_generate to analyze the issues, identify the most critical ones, and update the troubleshooting guide accordingly.\\n\\nI need to make sure that each new step correctly references the variables from previous steps and that the output variables are properly handled. Also, the final answer must be the updated troubleshooting guide that includes both verification and prioritization.\\n\\nI should also check that the sequence numbers are correctly incremented and that all steps are properly integrated into the plan without disrupting the existing flow.

Here's a comprehensive guide to help you diagnose and resolve these issues:\\n\\n### Understanding DDL Execution in TiDB\\n\\n1. **DDL Operations Overview**:\\n   - DDL (Data Definition Language) operations in TiDB are used to define, modify, and manage the structure of database objects. These include operations like `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `ADD INDEX`, and `MODIFY COLUMN`.\\n   - TiDB is designed to handle DDL operations online, meaning they should not block concurrent DML (Data Manipulation Language) operations. However, certain operations, such as adding indexes or partitions, may require additional processing like backfilling data.\\n\\n2. **Concurrency and Queuing**:\\n   - Before TiDB v6.2.0, DDL operations were queued in a first-in-first-out manner, which could lead to blocking if multiple DDL operations were executed simultaneously.\\n   - From TiDB v6.2.0 onwards, a concurrent framework was introduced, allowing multiple DDL operations to be processed simultaneously, reducing the likelihood of blocking.\\n\\n### Common Causes of Slow DDL Execution\\n\\n1. **Resource Contention**:\\n   - DDL operations can be resource-intensive, especially when adding partitions to large tables. Ensure that your TiDB cluster has sufficient CPU and memory resources to handle these operations.\\n\\n2. **Network Latency**:\\n   - Slow network communication between TiDB nodes and PD (Placement Driver) or TiKV can delay DDL operations. Check network performance and ensure low latency between components.\\n\\n3. **Schema Version Changes**:\\n   - Frequent schema changes can lead to increased DDL execution time. TiDB needs to ensure consistency across all nodes, which can be time-consuming if there are many schema changes.\\n\\n4. **DDL Owner Node Issues**:\\n   - The DDL owner node is responsible for executing DDL operations. If this node is experiencing issues or is overloaded, it can slow down DDL execution.\\n\\n### Troubleshooting Steps\\n\\n1. **Monitor Resource Usage**:\\n   - Use TiDB's monitoring tools to check CPU, memory, and network usage during DDL operations. Look for any bottlenecks or resource constraints.\\n\\n2. **Check DDL Owner Node**:\\n   - Identify the DDL owner node using the command `curl http://{TiDBIP}:10080/info/all` and ensure it is functioning correctly. If necessary, manually trigger an owner election with `curl -X POST http://{TiDBIP}:10080/ddl/owner/resign`.\\n\\n3. **Review DDL Execution Logs**:\\n   - Examine TiDB logs for any errors or warnings related to DDL execution. This can provide insights into what might be causing delays.\\n\\n4. **Optimize DDL Parameters**:\\n   - Adjust DDL-related parameters such as `tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt` and `tidb_ddl_reorg_batch_size` to optimize performance based on your workload.\\n\\n5. **Upgrade TiDB**:\\n   - Ensure you are using the latest stable version of TiDB, as newer versions often include performance improvements and bug fixes related to DDL operations.\\n\\n### Best Practices\\n\\n1. **Schedule DDL Operations During Off-Peak Hours**:\\n   - To minimize the impact on your production workload, schedule DDL operations during periods of low activity.\\n\\n2. **Test in a Staging Environment**:\\n   - Before applying DDL changes in production, test them in a staging environment to identify potential issues.\\n\\n3. **Use Partitioning Wisely**:\\n   - Partitioning can improve performance for large tables, but it should be used judiciously. Ensure that your partitioning strategy aligns with your query patterns.\\n\\nBy following these steps and best practices, you can effectively troubleshoot and optimize slow DDL execution when adding partitions in TiDB.

Here’s a comprehensive guide:\\n\\n### Understanding DDL Execution in TiDB\\n\\n1. **Concurrent Framework**: \\n   - From TiDB v6.2.0 onwards, the DDL module uses a concurrent framework, which allows multiple DDL tasks to be executed simultaneously. This framework eliminates the first-in-first-out queue limitation that existed in earlier versions, where DDL statements were processed in two separate queues for Reorg and General DDLs. This change significantly improves the efficiency of operations like adding partitions.\\n\\n2. **DDL Owner Node**:\\n   - The DDL Owner node is responsible for executing DDL tasks.

Older versions may experience blocking due to the queue system.\\n\\n2. **Network or Resource Bottlenecks**:\\n   - Check for network issues or resource constraints that might be affecting the TiDB nodes. Ensure that the cluster has adequate resources to handle DDL operations efficiently.\\n\\n3. **Owner Election Issues**:\\n   - If the DDL Owner is not functioning, manually trigger an owner election using `curl -X POST http://{TiDBIP}:10080/ddl/owner/resign`.\\n\\n### Best Practices\\n\\n1. **Upgrade to Latest Version**:\\n   - Always run the latest stable version of TiDB to ensure you have the latest performance improvements and bug fixes.\\n\\n2. **Monitor and Adjust Resources**:\\n   - Regularly monitor the cluster's performance using TiDB's monitoring tools and adjust resources as needed. This includes scaling up resources during peak DDL operations.\\n\\n3. **Optimize DDL Execution**:\\n   - Use system variables like `tidb_ddl_reorg_worker_cnt` and `tidb_ddl_reorg_batch_size` to balance the speed of DDL execution and the impact on application load. Adjust these settings based on the current load and resource availability.\\n\\n4. **Plan DDL Operations**:\\n   - Schedule DDL operations during off-peak hours to minimize the impact on application performance.

It used vector_search to find information on querying INFORMATION_SCHEMA and then llm_generate to create the DDL statements. However, the user suggested that the plan should focus on user-created tables, not just the INFORMATION_SCHEMA ones. That makes sense because the user probably wants DDLs for their own tables, not system tables.\\n\\nSo, the first thing I need to do is modify the vector_search step. Instead of a general query about INFORMATION_SCHEMA, I should make it more specific. I'll adjust the query to retrieve information on how to query both TABLES and COLUMNS from INFORMATION_SCHEMA for user tables. This way, we get the exact SQL needed to fetch all user tables and their columns.\\n\\nNext, in the llm_generate step, the prompt should instruct the LLM to generate DDL statements for all user tables. I should include details like columns, indexes, constraints, and other table properties. Also, since the response language is Japanese, I need to ensure the prompt specifies that.\\n\\nAnother suggestion was to add a verification step. The user wants to verify the generated DDL statements by comparing them with the actual table structures in TiDB. This could involve executing the DDLs in a test environment. To implement this, I can add a new calling step after generating the DDLs. This step would use llm_generate again to check each DDL statement against the actual table structure, ensuring accuracy.\\n\\nI should also consider adding comments to each step for clarity. This helps anyone reviewing the plan understand what each part does without confusion. It's especially useful for future maintenance or modifications.\\n\\nLooking at the structure, the current program counter is at step 3, which is the final assign step. I need to insert the new verification step after the existing llm_generate step (step 2). This means the new step will be step 3, and the final assign step will move to step 4. I have to adjust the seq_no accordingly to maintain the correct order.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that all steps up to and including step 2 remain unchanged, as per the user's instruction. Only steps after the current program counter can be modified or added.\\n\\nFinally, I'll make sure the new plan includes all necessary parameters and variable references correctly. For example, the vector_search step should output the query information into a variable, which is then used in the llm_generate step. The verification step will use the generated DDLs and compare them against the actual table structures, providing a verification status and any issues found.\\n\\nBy making these changes, the plan should now generate accurate DDL statements for user tables, include a verification step, and handle special cases, improving the overall reliability of the generated DDLs.\", 'plan': [{'parameters': {'goal': 'Generate DDL statements for all tables in TiDB'}, 'seq_no': 0, 'type': 'assign'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['table_metadata_info'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'How to query INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES and INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS for user tables in TiDB', 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 1, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['ddl_statements'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': '${table_metadata_info}', 'prompt': 'Using the information on querying INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES and INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS in TiDB, generate DDL statements for all user tables.

Ensure that this parameter is set appropriately to control the timing of region merges. For more details on configuring PD, refer to the [PD configuration file documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/pd-configuration-file#split-merge-interval).\\n\\n6. **Monitor and Adjust**:\\n   After enabling Region Merge, monitor the system to ensure that it is functioning as expected.

The primary reason for evicting leaders is to minimize the impact on user requests and maintain data consistency. When a TiKV node is upgraded, it is temporarily taken offline, which could disrupt the operations if it holds leadership roles. By evicting the leaders beforehand, the system ensures that the leadership responsibilities are transferred to other nodes, allowing the upgrade to proceed without causing significant disruptions or data inconsistencies.\\n\\nThe eviction process involves moving the leadership roles from the TiKV node that is about to be upgraded to other nodes in the cluster. This is done to ensure that the node can be safely restarted without affecting the availability of the data it manages. The process is typically automated and involves selecting the fastest available node to take over the leadership roles, thereby speeding up the overall process.\\n\\nHowever, the eviction process can sometimes hang or face delays. Several factors can contribute to this issue:\\n\\n1. **Slow Transaction Commits**: If there are ongoing large transactions that take a long time to commit, they can leave locks that delay the eviction process. These locks need to be resolved before the leadership can be transferred.\\n\\n2. **Long-lived Transactions**: Transactions that remain active for an extended period can block the advance of resolved timestamps, which are crucial for the eviction process. These transactions need to be identified and addressed to prevent delays.\\n\\n3. **Network Issues**: Problems with network connectivity can affect the communication between nodes, leading to delays in the eviction process. Monitoring network metrics can help identify and resolve such issues.\\n\\n4. **Configuration Issues**: Incorrect configuration settings, such as an improperly set `evictLeaderTimeout`, can lead to the eviction process hanging. Ensuring that the timeout is set to an appropriate value is essential to prevent such issues.\\n\\n5. **System Load**: High system load or resource contention can slow down the eviction process. Ensuring that the system has adequate resources and is not overloaded can help mitigate this issue.\\n\\nBy addressing these potential causes, the eviction process can be made more robust, ensuring a smooth upgrade process for TiKV nodes.', 'reasoning': 'To address the goal of understanding why it is necessary to evict TiKV leaders during a TiKV upgrade in a TiDB cluster and what could cause the eviction process to hang, we need to break down the task into several steps:\\n\\n1. **Problem Analysis and Hypothesis Generation**:\\n   - **Leader Eviction Necessity**: Understand the role of TiKV leaders in a TiDB cluster and why they need to be evicted during an upgrade.

This process involves several key components and steps:\\n\\n1. **Role of TiKV and Regions**: TiKV is the storage layer for TiDB, and it organizes data into regions. A region in TiKV is a logical division of data, typically containing a contiguous range of keys. Each region is responsible for a specific key range, and it is the basic unit of data storage and management in TiKV.\\n\\n2. **Key Range Allocation**: When a new table is created, TiDB assigns a unique table ID. The initial region for this table is created to cover the key range associated with this table ID. The key range is defined by a start key and an end key, which are derived from the table's primary key values. Initially, the region might cover a broad range, which can later be split into smaller regions as the data grows.\\n\\n3. **Role of the Placement Driver (PD)**: The Placement Driver (PD) is a crucial component in the TiDB ecosystem that manages the metadata and scheduling of regions across the TiKV nodes. When a new region is created, PD is responsible for determining the optimal placement of this region across the available TiKV nodes to ensure load balancing and high availability. PD uses a consensus algorithm to elect a leader for each region, which handles read and write requests.\\n\\n4. **Region Creation Process**: Upon table creation, TiDB communicates with PD to allocate the initial region for the table. PD assigns the region to a TiKV node, and the region is initialized with the specified key range. The leader of the region is elected, and the region becomes ready to handle data operations.\\n\\n5. **Automatic Rebalancing**: As data is inserted into the table and the region grows, TiDB and PD work together to automatically split the region into smaller regions to maintain performance and balance the load across the cluster. This dynamic management ensures that no single region becomes a bottleneck.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on how regions are managed and displayed, you can refer to the [TiDB documentation on SHOW TABLE REGIONS](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/sql-statement-show-table-regions).\", 'reasoning': 'To address the goal of understanding how the first region is created in TiKV when a new table is created in TiDB, we need to explore the internal mechanisms of TiDB and TiKV.

It is responsible for determining the distribution of regions and ensuring load balancing and high availability.\\n\\n2. **Initial Region Creation**: When a table is created, TiDB automatically creates an initial region to store the table's data. This region is responsible for a specific key range, which is determined by the table's primary key or row ID. The key range is typically set to cover the entire possible range of keys for the table, starting from negative infinity to positive infinity.\\n\\n3. **Key Range Management**: The initial region's key range is defined by the table's structure and the primary key. For example, if a table is created with an auto-increment primary key, the initial region will cover the range from the smallest possible key to the largest possible key. This range is managed by the PD, which keeps track of all regions and their key ranges.\\n\\n4. **Region Management by PD**: The PD continuously monitors the regions and their distribution across the TiKV nodes. It ensures that regions are evenly distributed to prevent hotspots and to maintain balanced load across the cluster. If a region becomes too large due to data growth, the PD will trigger a split operation to divide the region into smaller regions, each with its own key range.\\n\\n5. **Pre-Splitting Regions**: In some cases, especially when expecting high write loads, it is beneficial to pre-split regions to avoid initial write bottlenecks. This can be done using the `PRE_SPLIT_REGIONS` option during table creation, which pre-splits the table into multiple regions immediately after creation. This helps in distributing the load more evenly from the start.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on how regions are managed and split, you can refer to the TiDB documentation on [Split Region](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.2/sql-statement-split-region) and [SHOW TABLE REGIONS](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.2/sql-statement-show-table-regions).\", 'reasoning': \"Okay, so I need to figure out how to update the plan based on the user's suggestions.

It involves three main steps: retrieving knowledge from a knowledge graph, gathering detailed documentation using vector search, and then synthesizing this information with an LLM.\\n\\nThe user provided three suggestions to improve the plan:\\n\\n1. Add a step to retrieve specific SQL commands related to table creation in TiDB.\\n2.

Enhance the LLM prompt to request details on how the initial region's key range is determined and managed by PD.\\n\\nI need to incorporate these suggestions into the plan without altering the initial reasoning step. Let me go through each suggestion one by one.\\n\\nFirst, adding a step to retrieve SQL commands. This makes sense because understanding the SQL process can provide additional context on how regions are initialized. I'll add a new `calling` instruction after the initial reasoning step, using the vector search tool with a query focused on SQL commands related to table creation.\\n\\nNext, modifying the existing vector search. The current query is quite broad, so refining it to include more specifics about the interaction between TiDB and PD will yield more relevant results. I'll update the query in the vector search tool to something like 'TiDB table creation and PD region allocation'.\\n\\nLastly, enhancing the LLM prompt. The current prompt doesn't explicitly ask for details on key range determination and management. I'll modify the prompt to include these aspects, ensuring the final answer covers how PD handles the initial region's key range.\\n\\nNow, I'll structure these changes into the plan. After the reasoning step, I'll add the new vector search for SQL commands. Then, I'll modify the existing vector search step to use the more specific query. Finally, I'll update the LLM generation step to include the new details in the prompt.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that the variable names are correctly referenced and that each step logically follows the previous one. Since the new steps are added after the initial reasoning, the program counter will increment accordingly.\\n\\nLet me double-check that all steps are properly numbered and that the variables are correctly assigned. The new vector search will store its results in a new variable, say `sql_creation_docs`, and the existing vector search will still use `region_creation_docs`.

Here's a comprehensive approach to diagnose and address these issues:\\n\\n### Root Causes Analysis\\n\\n1. **Leader Election and Distribution Issues**:\\n   - The `err_not_leader` errors suggest that requests are being sent to TiKV nodes that are not the current leaders of their respective Raft groups. This can occur due to frequent leader elections or misconfigured leader distribution.\\n   - An imbalance in leader distribution can lead to certain nodes being overloaded, causing performance degradation and increased leader election frequency.\\n\\n2. **Network Partitions or Connectivity Issues**:\\n   - Unreachable stores indicate potential network partitions or connectivity issues between TiKV nodes. This can be due to network misconfigurations, DNS resolution problems, or issues with Kubernetes network components.\\n\\n3. **Hot Regions and Load Imbalance**:\\n   - Hot regions, which are regions with high read or write activity, can cause load imbalances. If these hot regions are not evenly distributed, it can lead to certain nodes being overloaded, exacerbating leader election issues.\\n\\n4. **Version and Configuration Mismatches**:\\n   - Running outdated versions of TiDB or TiKV that do not include fixes for known issues can contribute to these problems. Configuration mismatches, such as incorrect scheduling limits or weights, can also lead to imbalances.\\n\\n### Comprehensive Approach to Address the Issues\\n\\n1. **Upgrade and Patch**:\\n   - Ensure that your TiDB cluster is running the latest stable version that includes fixes for known issues related to leader elections and store availability. Regularly check for updates and apply patches as necessary.\\n\\n2. **Network Configuration and Monitoring**:\\n   - Verify network connectivity between nodes using tools like `ping`, `wget`, or `curl`. Ensure that all necessary ports are open and accessible.\\n   - Check DNS resolution using the `dig` command to ensure nodes can locate each other.\\n   - Monitor network metrics using Grafana to identify any anomalies or partitions.\\n\\n3. **Leader and Region Management**:\\n   - Use the `TIDB_HOT_REGIONS_HISTORY` table to analyze the distribution of hot regions and leaders. Adjust `leader-weight` and `region-weight` to achieve a more balanced distribution.\\n   - If there is a significant load imbalance, consider adjusting `leader-schedule-limit` and `region-schedule-limit` to improve scheduling efficiency.\\n\\n4. **Disaster Recovery and High Availability**:\\n   - Implement robust disaster recovery solutions, such as multiple replicas and primary-secondary cluster setups, to enhance error tolerance and availability.\\n   - Regularly test and validate your disaster recovery plans to ensure they can handle scenarios involving unreachable stores or leader issues.\\n\\n5. **Monitoring and Troubleshooting**:\\n   - Utilize TiDB's monitoring tools to keep track of the state of all components, including TiKV and PD. This can help identify issues early and take corrective actions before they escalate.\\n   - Retrieve and analyze TiDB and TiKV logs for error spikes and network events to identify patterns or repeated error messages that might indicate the root cause.\\n\\n6. **Consult Documentation and Resources**:\\n   - Refer to the official TiDB and TiKV documentation for guidance on interpreting log entries and troubleshooting common issues.\\n   - If needed, consult the TiDB Cluster Troubleshooting Guide for detailed steps on diagnosing and resolving connectivity issues and process failures.\\n\\nBy following this comprehensive approach, you can effectively manage `err_not_leader` errors and handle scenarios involving unreachable stores in your TiDB environment, ensuring improved performance and reliability.\", 'reasoning': \"Alright, let's tackle this problem.

Let's go through each suggestion and see how they fit into the current structure.\\n\\n1. **Retrieve Logs for Error Spikes and Network Events**:\\n   - This makes sense because logs can reveal patterns or spikes in errors, which could indicate network issues, leader election problems, or configuration issues. I'll add steps to retrieve TiDB and TiKV logs. Using `vector_search`, I can look for relevant documentation on how to retrieve these logs. Then, `llm_generate` can process these logs to summarize error trends and correlate them with network events.\\n\\n2. **Assess Leader Distribution and Load Balancing**:\\n   - Leader distribution is crucial. If leaders are unevenly distributed, some stores might become overloaded, leading to unreachable states or `err_not_leader` errors. I'll include steps to use `vector_search` to find information on monitoring leader distribution and `llm_generate` to analyze whether the current distribution is balanced.\\n\\n3. **Verify Network Configurations and Monitor for Partitions**:\\n   - Network issues can cause stores to become unreachable. Checking network configurations and monitoring for partitions can help identify if network problems are the root cause. I'll add steps to retrieve network configuration settings and use `llm_generate` to analyze them. Additionally, I'll include monitoring steps to check for ongoing network partitions.\\n\\nI'll structure these additions after the initial information gathering steps. This way, the plan first collects foundational information on region management and leader election, then dives into specific areas like logs, leader distribution, and network configurations.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that each new step properly references output variables and uses the available tools correctly. For example, when retrieving logs, I'll use `vector_search` to find how to retrieve them and then `llm_generate` to summarize the findings.\\n\\nAnother consideration is maintaining the flow of the plan. Each step should logically follow the previous one, ensuring that the analysis builds upon the gathered information. This will help in systematically narrowing down the potential causes.\\n\\nI must also remember to keep the final answer aligned with the goal. All steps should contribute to identifying the root cause of the `err_not_leader` errors and unreachable stores, leading to actionable solutions.\\n\\nFinally, I'll review the entire plan to ensure it adheres to the VM specification, uses the correct instruction types, and properly references variables. This includes checking that the `seq_no` values are unique and sequential, and that all variable references are correctly formatted.\\n\\nBy integrating these suggestions, the updated plan will provide a more comprehensive analysis, addressing not only the region management and leader election processes but also potential issues with logs, leader distribution, and network configurations. This should lead to a more effective troubleshooting process and better solutions for the user's issue.\", 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': \"The Grafana TiKV Details panel reporting many stores as unreachable and showing err_not_leader errors suggests issues with region leader election or network connectivity.

Each tool plays a distinct role in the replication process, leveraging specific mechanisms to maintain data integrity and consistency.\\n\\n### TiDB Data Migration (DM)\\n\\nTiDB DM is designed to facilitate the migration of data from MySQL or MariaDB databases to TiDB. It supports both full data migration and incremental data replication. The incremental replication process involves parsing MySQL binlogs, which are logs of all changes made to the database. DM captures these changes and applies them to the TiDB cluster, ensuring that the data in TiDB remains consistent with the source MySQL database.\\n\\nKey features of DM include:\\n\\n- **Binlog Parsing**: DM reads and parses MySQL binlogs to capture data changes. This includes Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations.\\n- **Conflict Handling**: DM can handle potential conflicts, such as primary key or unique index duplicates, by adjusting schema configurations.\\n- **Shard Merging**: DM supports merging data from sharded MySQL tables into a single table in TiDB, coordinating Shard DDL statements to maintain consistency.\\n\\nFor more details on DM, you can refer to the [DM overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/dm-overview).\\n\\n### TiCDC\\n\\nTiCDC is a change data capture tool that captures row-level changes from TiDB clusters and replicates them to various downstream systems, including databases like MySQL, message queues like Kafka, and storage services. It supports real-time data replication and ensures transactional consistency for single tables and eventual consistency for multi-table replication.\\n\\nKey features of TiCDC include:\\n\\n- **Changefeeds**: TiCDC uses changefeeds to track changes in the TiDB cluster. Each changefeed corresponds to a replication task that specifies the tables to be replicated and the downstream system.\\n- **Data Consistency**: TiCDC ensures data consistency by maintaining a consistent snapshot between the upstream TiDB and downstream systems. It uses a mechanism called Syncpoint to align snapshots periodically, allowing for consistent reads and data validation.\\n- **Output Formats**: TiCDC supports various output formats, such as Canal-JSON and Avro, to integrate with different platforms.\\n\\nFor more information on TiCDC, you can visit the [TiCDC overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/ticdc-overview).\\n\\nBoth TiDB DM and TiCDC are integral to maintaining data consistency during incremental replication, each with its specialized mechanisms for handling data changes and ensuring that the replicated data remains consistent with the source.', 'reasoning': 'Okay, I need to help update the execution plan based on the user\\'s suggestions.

Here’s a detailed analysis and recommendation based on schema design principles and TiDB performance implications:\\n\\n### Significance of Column Placement\\n\\n1. **Data Integrity and Structure**: Columns are fundamental in defining the structure of a table. They should be designed with meaningful names and appropriate data types to ensure clarity and efficiency. This helps in maintaining data integrity and makes the database easier to understand and manage.\\n\\n2. **Performance Optimization**: The choice of primary keys and indexes significantly impacts performance. For instance, using a single monotonic data column as a primary key can lead to write performance issues due to hotspots. Instead, using `AUTO_RANDOM` or sharding techniques like `SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS` can help distribute data more evenly across regions, reducing hotspots and improving performance. More details on handling hotspots can be found [here](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.3/sql-faq).\\n\\n3. **Schema Design Considerations**: Effective schema design involves understanding the workload patterns and avoiding transaction contention or hotspots. This includes selecting appropriate data types, defining primary keys, and using clustered indexes where beneficial. For example, clustered indexes can improve performance by reducing network reads and writes, especially when queries involve primary key conditions. However, they can also increase storage space if the primary key data type is large. For more on schema design, refer to [this guide](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/dev-guide-create-table).\\n\\n4. **Column Naming Conventions**: Consistent and meaningful column naming conventions are recommended to enhance readability and maintainability. This includes using actual meanings or abbreviations for column names, avoiding reserved words, and adhering to character limits. This practice not only aids in understanding the schema but also prevents potential conflicts during query execution.\\n\\n### Recommendations\\n\\n- **Use Meaningful and Consistent Naming**: Follow a clear naming convention for columns to ensure that the schema is intuitive and easy to navigate. This includes using descriptive names and avoiding reserved words.\\n\\n- **Optimize Primary Key Selection**: Avoid using single monotonic columns as primary keys in write-intensive scenarios. Instead, consider using `AUTO_RANDOM` or sharding techniques to distribute data evenly and prevent hotspots.\\n\\n- **Leverage Clustered Indexes**: Use clustered indexes to improve query performance, especially for queries involving primary key conditions. However, be mindful of the potential increase in storage space.\\n\\n- **Monitor and Adjust Schema Design**: Regularly review and adjust the schema design based on application workload patterns to avoid transaction conflicts and hotspots. Utilize tools like Key Visualizer to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues.\\n\\nBy carefully considering these aspects of column placement and schema design, you can significantly enhance the performance and efficiency of your TiDB database.

When designing a schema, it's important to consider how data is organized and accessed, as this can affect transaction contention and hotspot issues.\\n\\n### Column Placement and Schema Design\\n\\n1. **Schema Design Considerations**: Effective schema design involves defining tables, columns, relationships, data types, and constraints. This helps ensure data integrity and efficiency. A well-designed schema can prevent transaction conflicts and hotspots, which are common performance bottlenecks in distributed systems like TiDB. For more details on schema design principles, you can refer to [this guide](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/dev-guide-optimize-sql-overview).\\n\\n2. **Column Naming and Organization**: Consistent and meaningful column naming conventions are recommended. This includes using actual meanings or abbreviations for column names, ensuring consistency across tables, and avoiding reserved words. Proper naming and organization can enhance readability and maintainability of the database schema.\\n\\n### TiDB's Support for the AFTER Clause\\n\\nTiDB supports the `AFTER` clause in `ALTER TABLE` statements, which allows you to specify the position of a new column relative to existing columns. However, there are some compatibility considerations with MySQL. For instance, when altering multiple schema objects in a single `ALTER TABLE` statement, TiDB processes changes sequentially from left to right, which might differ from MySQL's behavior. Additionally, TiDB validates statements according to the table schema before execution, which can lead to errors if the specified column does not exist at the time of execution. For more information on TiDB's compatibility with MySQL, see [this documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/sql-statement-alter-table).\\n\\n### SQL Example Using the AFTER Clause\\n\\nHere is an example of how to use the `AFTER` clause in TiDB:\\n\\n```sql\\nALTER TABLE my_table ADD COLUMN new_column INT AFTER existing_column;\\n```\\n\\nThis statement adds a new column named `new_column` immediately after `existing_column` in the table `my_table`.\\n\\n### Performance Implications\\n\\nColumn placement can affect query performance, especially in terms of how data is accessed and processed. For instance, placing frequently accessed columns together can improve cache efficiency and reduce I/O operations. Additionally, understanding and mitigating hotspot issues is crucial for maintaining optimal performance in TiDB. Techniques such as using `SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS` or `AUTO_RANDOM` can help distribute data more evenly across regions, reducing the likelihood of hotspots. For more insights on handling hotspots and optimizing performance, refer to [this resource](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v5.4/sql-faq).\\n\\n### Recommendations\\n\\n- **Use the AFTER Clause**: When adding new columns, use the `AFTER` clause to control their placement, which can help maintain logical data organization and potentially improve query performance.\\n- **Optimize Schema Design**: Regularly review and optimize your schema design to prevent transaction contention and hotspots. Consider the relationships between data elements and choose appropriate data types and constraints.\\n- **Monitor and Tune Performance**: Continuously monitor your TiDB cluster for performance issues and use available tools and techniques to address hotspots and optimize query execution.\\n\\nBy carefully considering column placement and schema design, you can enhance the performance and scalability of your TiDB database.\", 'reasoning': \"Alright, I need to update the plan based on the user's suggestions.

Let me start by understanding the current plan and the goal.\\n\\nThe goal is to explain what a filter index is in TiDB and how it can be used. The original plan included steps to retrieve knowledge from the knowledge graph, perform a vector search, and then generate the final answer using an LLM. However, the user suggested verifying if 'filter index' is a recognized concept in TiDB before proceeding.\\n\\nFirst, I'll check if there's a way to verify the existence of 'filter index' in TiDB's documentation. The plan currently uses both 'retrieve_knowledge_graph' and 'vector_search' to gather information. Maybe I can add a step to specifically search for the term in TiDB's official documentation or community discussions.\\n\\nIf 'filter index' isn't found, the plan should shift to explaining related indexing concepts. So, I'll need to add a conditional check after the initial retrieval steps. This can be done using the 'jmp' instruction, which allows the plan to branch based on a condition.\\n\\nI'll introduce a new step after the knowledge graph and vector search steps. This step will use the 'llm_generate' tool to evaluate whether the retrieved information includes the term 'filter index'. If it does, the plan proceeds to generate the final answer. If not, it jumps to a new section that explains alternative indexing strategies in TiDB.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that the final answer clearly states whether 'filter index' is a recognized concept. If it isn't, the answer should provide relevant information on related features like secondary indexes or covering indexes, possibly with SQL examples.\\n\\nAnother consideration is variable management. The plan assigns variables for the knowledge graph data and vector search results. I'll need to make sure that any new variables introduced, such as 'filter_index_exists' or 'alternative_indexing', are properly handled and referenced in subsequent steps.\\n\\nI should also maintain the plan's efficiency by avoiding redundant steps. For example, if 'filter index' isn't found, the plan shouldn't re-run the initial retrieval steps but instead proceed to generate the alternative explanation.\\n\\nFinally, I'll ensure that the plan adheres to the VM specification, with proper sequence numbering and instruction types. The final answer must be stored in the variable 'final_answer' as per the guidelines.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the updated plan will include a conditional check after retrieving information, branching based on the existence of 'filter index', and providing appropriate explanations in either case.\", 'plan_commit_hash': 'ef6785e3eb4444f39a317a22bc3af40e', 'answers': [{'commit_hash': '0194ec0e1fb8490fbc7861e5ad9cf43a', 'committed_at': '2025-02-18T03:49:40', 'description': \"Executed seq_no: 3, step: 'calling', tool: llm_generate\", 'seq_no': 3, 'commit_type': 'StepExecution', 'parent_hash': 'a305e7ef9e0f4c1eaee2e34f5dfaa4b1', 'final_answer': 'The documents provided do not explicitly mention a \"filter index\" in TiDB. However, they do discuss best practices for creating and using indexes, which can help optimize query performance in TiDB. Here are some key points about index usage in TiDB:\\n\\n1. **Combined Indexes**: Creating a combined index with multiple columns can optimize performance through a technique called covering index optimization. This allows TiDB to query data directly on indexes, improving query efficiency.\\n\\n2. **Secondary Indexes**: It\\'s important to avoid creating secondary indexes on columns that are not frequently queried. While secondary indexes can speed up queries, they also add overhead during data insertion and consume additional storage space. Too many indexes can also complicate the optimizer\\'s task and potentially degrade performance.\\n\\n3. **Appropriate Indexing**: Indexes should be created based on the application\\'s needs. For example, columns with a high degree of distinction (such as personal ID numbers) are good candidates for indexing, as they can significantly reduce the number of rows that need to be filtered during a query.\\n\\n4. **Combined Index Usage**: When querying with multiple conditions, using combined indexes can be beneficial. For instance, if a query frequently uses conditions like `SELECT * FROM t WHERE c1 = 10 AND c2 = 100 AND c3 > 10`, a combined index on `(c1, c2, c3)` can be created to optimize the query.\\n\\n5. **Index Naming**: It\\'s recommended to name secondary indexes meaningfully, following the naming conventions of your organization or the guidelines provided in the [Index Naming Specification](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/dev-guide-object-naming-guidelines).\\n\\nFor more detailed information on best practices for indexing in TiDB, you can refer to the following sources:\\n- [Best Practices for Indexing in TiDB Cloud](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/dev-guide-index-best-practice)\\n- [Best Practices for Indexing in TiDB v8.4](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/dev-guide-index-best-practice)\\n- [Best Practices for Indexing in TiDB v7.5](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.5/dev-guide-index-best-practice)\\n\\nThese documents provide comprehensive guidelines on how to effectively use indexes in TiDB to enhance query performance.', 'reasoning': None, 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': \"To understand what a filter index is in TiDB and how it can be used, we will follow a structured approach: 1.

While \"filter index\" is not a recognized concept in TiDB, there are several related indexing concepts that might be relevant to your query, such as secondary indexes and covering indexes.\\n\\n### Secondary Indexes\\nSecondary indexes are additional indexes created on columns other than the primary key. They can significantly speed up query performance by reducing the number of rows scanned. However, it\\'s important to use them judiciously, as they can also slow down write operations and consume additional storage space. When creating secondary indexes, it\\'s advisable to focus on columns that are frequently queried and have a high degree of distinction.\\n\\n### Covering Indexes\\nA covering index is a type of optimization where a query can be satisfied entirely by the index itself, without needing to access the actual table data. This is achieved by creating a combined index on multiple columns that are used in the query. This optimization allows TiDB to retrieve data directly from the index, improving query performance.\\n\\n#### SQL Example for Creating a Combined Index\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE `books` (\\n  `id` bigint(20) AUTO_RANDOM NOT NULL,\\n  `title` varchar(100) NOT NULL,\\n  `type` enum(\\'Magazine\\', \\'Novel\\', \\'Life\\', \\'Arts\\', \\'Comics\\', \\'Education & Reference\\', \\'Humanities & Social Sciences\\', \\'Science & Technology\\', \\'Kids\\', \\'Sports\\') NOT NULL,\\n  `published_at` datetime NOT NULL,\\n  `stock` int(11) DEFAULT \\'0\\',\\n  `price` decimal(15,2) DEFAULT \\'0.0\\',\\n  PRIMARY KEY (`id`) CLUSTERED\\n) DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_bin;\\n\\n-- Creating a combined index for covering index optimization\\nCREATE INDEX idx_combined ON books (title, type, published_at);\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, a combined index is created on the `title`, `type`, and `published_at` columns of the `books` table. This allows queries that filter or sort by these columns to be executed more efficiently.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on best practices for creating and using indexes in TiDB, you can refer to the following source: [Best Practices for Indexing](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/dev-guide-index-best-practice).', 'reasoning': \"Alright, so I'm trying to help update the plan based on the user's suggestions.

However, the user suggested verifying if 'filter index' is a recognized concept in TiDB before proceeding.\\n\\nFirst, I'll check if there's a way to verify the existence of 'filter index' in TiDB's documentation. The plan currently uses both 'retrieve_knowledge_graph' and 'vector_search' to gather information. Maybe I can add a step to specifically search for the term in TiDB's official documentation or community discussions.\\n\\nIf 'filter index' isn't found, the plan should shift to explaining related indexing concepts. So, I'll need to add a conditional check after the initial retrieval steps. This can be done using the 'jmp' instruction, which allows the plan to branch based on a condition.\\n\\nI'll introduce a new step after the knowledge graph and vector search steps. This step will use the 'llm_generate' tool to evaluate whether the retrieved information includes the term 'filter index'. If it does, the plan proceeds to generate the final answer.

If it isn't, the answer should provide relevant information on related features like secondary indexes or covering indexes, possibly with SQL examples.\\n\\nAnother consideration is variable management. The plan assigns variables for the knowledge graph data and vector search results. I'll need to make sure that any new variables introduced, such as 'filter_index_exists' or 'alternative_indexing', are properly handled and referenced in subsequent steps.\\n\\nI should also maintain the plan's efficiency by avoiding redundant steps.

Secondary indexes are useful when you frequently query non-primary key columns. However, it\\'s important to note that adding too many secondary indexes can slow down write operations and consume more storage space.\\n\\n   **Example**:\\n   ```sql\\n   CREATE TABLE books (\\n     id BIGINT AUTO_RANDOM PRIMARY KEY,\\n     title VARCHAR(100),\\n     author VARCHAR(100),\\n     published_at DATETIME\\n   );\\n\\n   CREATE INDEX idx_author ON books(author);\\n   ```\\n\\n   In this example, a secondary index is created on the `author` column to speed up queries that filter by author.\\n\\n2. **Covering Indexes**: This is an optimization technique where the index contains all the columns needed for a query, allowing TiDB to retrieve data directly from the index without accessing the table. This can significantly improve query performance.\\n\\n   **Example**:\\n   ```sql\\n   CREATE INDEX idx_title_author ON books(title, author);\\n   ```\\n\\n   If a query only needs the `title` and `author` columns, TiDB can use this covering index to avoid accessing the table data.\\n\\n3. **Partitioning Strategies**: While not an index per se, partitioning can be used to improve query performance by dividing a table into smaller, more manageable pieces. This can be particularly useful for large datasets.\\n\\n   **Example**:\\n   ```sql\\n   CREATE TABLE sales (\\n     id BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\\n     sale_date DATE,\\n     amount DECIMAL(10, 2)\\n   ) PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(sale_date)) (\\n     PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN (2020),\\n     PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (2021),\\n     PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (2022)\\n   );\\n   ```\\n\\n   This example partitions the `sales` table by year, which can improve query performance for date-based queries.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on best practices for creating and using indexes in TiDB, you can refer to the official documentation: [Best Practices for Indexing](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/dev-guide-index-best-practice).', 'reasoning': \"Okay, so I need to update the plan based on the user's suggestions.

Here are some potential causes and a comprehensive solution to address these issues:\\n\\n### Potential Causes of Schema Lease Errors\\n\\n1. **Version Mismatch**: Schema lease errors can occur when different nodes in the TiDB cluster have inconsistent schema versions. This can happen if a node fails to update its schema version due to network issues or if the schema change is not propagated correctly.\\n\\n2. **Network Latency**: High network latency can delay the propagation of schema changes across the cluster, leading to temporary inconsistencies and schema lease errors.\\n\\n3. **Configuration Issues**: Incorrect configuration of the schema lease duration can lead to errors. If the lease duration is too short, nodes may not have enough time to update their schema versions before the lease expires.\\n\\n4. **High Concurrency**: In scenarios with high concurrency, multiple schema changes might be attempted simultaneously, leading to conflicts and errors if not managed properly.\\n\\n### Comprehensive Solution\\n\\n1. **Ensure Consistent Schema Versioning**: Implement robust mechanisms to ensure that schema changes are consistently propagated across all nodes. This can include using a centralized schema management service that tracks and coordinates schema changes.\\n\\n2. **Optimize Network Configuration**: Reduce network latency by optimizing the network configuration and ensuring that all nodes are well-connected. This can involve upgrading network infrastructure or optimizing routing paths.\\n\\n3. **Adjust Schema Lease Duration**: Review and adjust the schema lease duration configuration to ensure it is appropriate for the cluster's size and network conditions. A longer lease duration can provide more time for nodes to update their schema versions.\\n\\n4. **Implement Conflict Resolution Mechanisms**: Develop mechanisms to handle conflicts that arise from concurrent schema changes. This can include using locking mechanisms or implementing a queue system to serialize schema changes.\\n\\n5. **Monitor and Alert**: Set up monitoring and alerting systems to detect schema lease errors promptly. This can help in quickly identifying and resolving issues before they impact the database's operation.\\n\\n6. **Regular Testing and Validation**: Conduct regular testing and validation of schema changes in a staging environment before applying them to the production environment. This can help identify potential issues early.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on specific schema lease issues and solutions, you can refer to the TiDB documentation available at [TiDB 3.0.0-rc.3 Release Notes](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.1/release-3.0.0-rc.3) and [TiDB 2.1.16 Release Notes](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.5/release-2.1.16).\", 'reasoning': \"To diagnose and resolve schema lease errors on a single TiDB node, we need to follow a structured approach.

Here’s a comprehensive analysis of potential causes and solutions, along with guidance on using `tidb-ctl` commands to diagnose and resolve these issues.\\n\\n### Potential Causes of Schema Lease Errors\\n\\n1. **Improper Lease Configuration**: The `lease` parameter in TiDB affects the speed of Database Schema Changes (DDL). If set too low, it might lead to frequent schema lease errors, especially in production environments where DDL safety is crucial.\\n\\n2. **Network Issues**: Communication problems between TiDB and PD (Placement Driver) can prevent TiDB from updating or retrieving version information, leading to schema lease errors.\\n\\n3. **Cluster Start-Up Delays**: After starting the TiDB cluster, the first DDL operation might take longer due to the election of the DDL leader, which can cause temporary schema lease issues.\\n\\n4. **Concurrent DDL Operations**: Executing multiple DDL statements simultaneously can slow down the process, as DDL operations are executed serially in TiDB.\\n\\n### Comprehensive Solution\\n\\n#### Step 1: Verify and Adjust Lease Configuration\\n\\n- **Check Current Lease Setting**: Ensure that the `lease` parameter is set appropriately. In production, it is recommended to set it to a higher value (e.g., 60 seconds) to ensure DDL safety.\\n- **Adjust Lease Parameter**: If necessary, adjust the lease parameter by restarting the TiDB server with the desired lease value using the command line option `--lease=<value>`.\\n\\n#### Step 2: Diagnose Network Issues\\n\\n- **Check Network Connectivity**: Ensure that there is stable network connectivity between TiDB and PD servers. Use network diagnostic tools to verify the connection.\\n- **Monitor PD Logs**: Check PD logs for any network-related errors that might affect schema operations.\\n\\n#### Step 3: Use `tidb-ctl` for Diagnosis\\n\\n- **Install `tidb-ctl`**: Ensure that `tidb-ctl` is installed on your system. It is a command-line tool for managing and diagnosing TiDB clusters.\\n- **Check DDL Status**: Use `tidb-ctl` to check the status of DDL operations. The command `tidb-ctl ddl status` can provide insights into the current DDL operations and their states.\\n- **Interpret Outputs**: Look for any anomalies or errors in the output that might indicate issues with schema leases or DDL operations.\\n\\n#### Step 4: Address Concurrent DDL Operations\\n\\n- **Schedule DDL Operations**: Avoid running multiple DDL operations simultaneously. Schedule them during low-traffic periods to minimize impact.\\n- **Monitor DDL Performance**: Use TiDB’s monitoring tools to track the performance of DDL operations and adjust the workload accordingly.\\n\\n### Reference\\n\\nFor more detailed information on managing TiDB clusters and handling schema lease issues, you can refer to the official TiDB documentation:\\n\\n- [TiDB Cluster Management FAQs](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.5/manage-cluster-faq)\\n\\nBy following these steps and utilizing the `tidb-ctl` tool, you can effectively diagnose and resolve schema lease errors in TiDB, ensuring smooth and efficient database operations.', 'reasoning': \"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help the user diagnose and resolve schema lease errors on a single TiDB node using tools like `tidb-ctl`.

This guide provides a comprehensive approach to diagnosing and resolving these errors using `tidb-ctl` commands and other troubleshooting techniques.\\n\\n#### Step 1: Verify Current Lease Configuration\\n\\n**Command**: `tidb-ctl lease`\\n\\n- **Purpose**: To check the current lease duration setting on the TiDB node.\\n- **Example Output**:\\n  ```\\n  Lease: 45s\\n  ```\\n- **Interpretation**: The lease duration is set to 45 seconds. This setting impacts how quickly schema changes propagate across the cluster. Ensure this value is appropriate for your environment—typically longer in production for safety.\\n\\n#### Step 2: List and Monitor DDL Jobs\\n\\n**Command**: `tidb-ctl ddl jobs`\\n\\n- **Purpose**: To list ongoing and completed DDL jobs, helping identify any long-running or stuck operations.\\n- **Example Output**:\\n  ```\\n  Job ID: 12345\\n  Type: Add Index\\n  State: Running\\n  Schema State: Write Only\\n  ```\\n- **Interpretation**: A running DDL job is shown. If a job is stuck, it may indicate a schema lease issue. Investigate further if jobs remain in a non-final state for too long.\\n\\n#### Step 3: Identify the Current DDL Owner\\n\\n**Command**: `tidb-ctl ddl owner`\\n\\n- **Purpose**: To determine which TiDB node is the current DDL owner, responsible for executing schema changes.\\n- **Example Output**:\\n  ```\\n  DDL Owner: tidb-server-1\\n  ```\\n- **Interpretation**: `tidb-server-1` is the DDL owner. If schema lease issues persist, check this node's logs and status for potential problems.\\n\\n#### Step 4: Review DDL History\\n\\n**Command**: `tidb-ctl ddl history`\\n\\n- **Purpose**: To view a history of completed DDL jobs, useful for spotting patterns or recurring issues.\\n- **Example Output**:\\n  ```\\n  Job ID: 12344\\n  Type: Create Table\\n  State: Finished\\n  Duration: 30s\\n  ```\\n- **Interpretation**: A completed DDL job with its duration is shown. Unusually long durations may indicate past schema lease or execution issues.\\n\\n#### Step 5: Check Schema Version Consistency\\n\\n**Command**: `tidb-ctl schema version`\\n\\n- **Purpose**: To verify the current schema version on the TiDB node, ensuring it is up-to-date.\\n- **Example Output**:\\n  ```\\n  Schema Version: 202502182025\\n  ```\\n- **Interpretation**: The schema version is displayed. Discrepancies between nodes may suggest synchronization issues.\\n\\n#### Common Causes and Solutions\\n\\n1. **Improper Lease Configuration**:\\n   - **Solution**: Adjust the `lease` parameter to a suitable value for your environment. Use `tidb-ctl lease` to verify settings.\\n\\n2. **Network Issues Between TiDB and PD**:\\n   - **Solution**: Ensure stable network connectivity between TiDB and PD. Use network diagnostic tools to check for partitions or latency.\\n\\n3. **High Load or Resource Contention**:\\n   - **Solution**: Monitor system resources. If usage is high, consider scaling the cluster or optimizing workloads.\\n\\n4. **DDL Owner Election Delays**:\\n   - **Solution**: Ensure a stable cluster environment. Check logs for election-related errors and use `tidb-ctl ddl owner` to verify the current owner.\\n\\n5. **Stale Metadata**:\\n   - **Solution**: Shut down TiDB gracefully to clean up registration data. Avoid using `kill -9` to stop processes.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on managing TiDB clusters and addressing schema lease errors, refer to the official TiDB documentation: [TiDB Cluster Management FAQs](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v5.4/manage-cluster-faq).\", 'reasoning': \"Okay, I'm trying to help the user with their schema lease error issue on a single TiDB node.

Each step should assign variables that the next step can reference. For example, after clarifying the intent, we store it in a variable and use it in the vector_search.\\n\\nAnother consideration is the structure of the plan. It needs to follow the VM's instruction types, so adding a calling instruction for llm_generate to ask the user makes sense. Then, another calling step for vector_search with the refined query.\\n\\nI should also make sure that all steps are sequential and that each instruction's seq_no is correctly incremented. No steps before seq_no 2 should be changed since the program counter is at 2.\\n\\nFinally, after getting the relevant snippets, the llm_generate step should synthesize the response in Chinese, ensuring it's coherent and addresses the user's clarified intent.\\n\\nSo, the key changes are adding steps to clarify the user's intent and refining the vector search based on that clarification, while maintaining the flow and variable references correctly.\", 'plan_commit_hash': 'cf488c6b713c4f60bb552a805a6c66e1', 'answers': [{'commit_hash': 'b855b8a245454a219f02d93e7cb606ac', 'committed_at': '2025-02-18T08:15:03', 'description': 'Executed seq_no: 3, step: assign', 'seq_no': 3, 'commit_type': 'StepExecution', 'parent_hash': '3e05b912dc5e42019a85f606f8060499', 'final_answer': '根据提供的信息，`tempDir.go:76` 可能涉及 TiDB 的代码库或错误信息。虽然具体的代码行或错误信息没有直接提到，但可以推测这可能与 TiDB 的部署或运行环境有关，特别是在使用 TiUP 工具进行本地测试集群的部署时。\\n\\nTiUP 是一个用于管理 TiDB 集群的工具，允许用户快速启动和管理 TiDB 集群。在部署本地测试集群时，TiUP 会创建临时目录用于存储集群的相关数据和配置文件。`tempDir.go:76` 可能涉及到创建或管理这些临时目录的代码部分。如果在这部分代码中出现错误，可能会导致集群启动失败或数据存储问题。\\n\\n如果您在使用 TiUP 部署 TiDB 集群时遇到与 `tempDir.go:76` 相关的错误，建议检查以下几点：\\n\\n1. 确保 TiUP 已正确安装并配置环境变量。\\n2. 检查是否有足够的磁盘空间用于创建临时目录。\\n3. 查看 TiUP 的日志文件以获取更详细的错误信息。\\n\\n有关 TiUP 的更多信息和使用指南，可以参考以下链接：\\n- [TiDB v8.4 快速入门指南](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/quick-start-with-tidb)\\n- [TiDB v7.5 快速入门指南](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.5/quick-start-with-tidb)\\n\\n这些文档提供了关于如何使用 TiUP 部署和管理 TiDB 集群的详细步骤和注意事项。', 'reasoning': 'The goal is to address a user\\'s request related to a specific line in a Go file, possibly associated with TiDB\\'s codebase.

execution state. The goal is to address a query about a specific line in a Go file, tempDir.go:76, which might be related to TiDB's codebase.\\n\\nFirst, I look at the current plan. It starts by assigning a query, then uses vector_search to find relevant snippets, followed by llm_generate to create a response in Chinese. But there's a suggestion to improve this by clarifying the user's intent and refining the vector search.\\n\\nThe main issue is that without knowing exactly what the user is asking about tempDir.go:76, the search might not be precise. So, the plan should first ask the user for more details. That makes sense because the current approach assumes the user is asking about TiDB, but maybe they're not.\\n\\nSo, the updated plan needs to include a step where we prompt the user for clarification. Using llm_generate, we can craft a message asking for more context. Once we have that, we can adjust the vector_search query to be more specific, whether it's about TiDB, an error, or something else.\\n\\nI also need to ensure that the output variables are correctly handled. Each step should assign variables that the next step can reference. For example, after clarifying the intent, we store it in a variable and use it in the vector_search.\\n\\nAnother consideration is the structure of the plan. It needs to follow the VM's instruction types, so adding a calling instruction for llm_generate to ask the user makes sense. Then, another calling step for vector_search with the refined query.\\n\\nI should also make sure that all steps are sequential and that each instruction's seq_no is correctly incremented. No steps before seq_no 2 should be changed since the program counter is at 2.\\n\\nFinally, after getting the relevant snippets, the llm_generate step should synthesize the response in Chinese, ensuring it's coherent and addresses the user's clarified intent.\\n\\nSo, the key changes are adding steps to clarify the user's intent and refining the vector search based on that clarification, while maintaining the flow and variable references correctly.\", 'plan': [{'parameters': {'query': 'tempDir.go:76 TiDB'}, 'seq_no': 0, 'type': 'assign'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['relevant_snippets'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': '${query}', 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 1, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['clarification_request'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': '', 'prompt': '请提供更多关于tempDir.go:76的具体信息或上下文。您是想了解该行代码的功能、排查与之相关的错误，还是其他内容？'}}, 'seq_no': 2, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['relevant_snippets_refined'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'tempDir.go:76 ${clarification_request}', 'top_k': 5}}, 'seq_no': 3, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['synthesized_response'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': '${relevant_snippets_refined}', 'prompt': '请基于以下信息，提供关于tempDir.go:76的详细说明，可涉及TiDB代码库或错误信息。请确保生成的文本使用中文。\\n\\n${relevant_snippets_refined}'}}, 'seq_no': 4, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'final_answer': '${synthesized_response}'}, 'seq_no': 5, 'type': 'assign'}]}], 'qualified_answers': [], 'is_valid': False, 'language': 'Chinese'}\n",

Understand the encoding mechanism: TiDB uses a key-value encoding mechanism to store data. Each row of data in a table is encoded as a key-value pair. The key is constructed using a combination of a table prefix, a unique TableID, a record prefix separator, and a RowID. The value part of the key-value pair contains the actual data for the row, represented as a list of column values.\\n\\nFor index data, TiDB uses a similar encoding approach. The key for an index is constructed using a table prefix, the TableID, an index prefix separator, the IndexID, and the values of the indexed columns. In the case of unique indexes, this key structure is sufficient to ensure uniqueness. However, for non-unique indexes, the RowID is appended to the key to maintain uniqueness, as multiple rows might have the same indexed column values.\\n\\nThis encoding mechanism helps TiDB efficiently manage and retrieve data within its distributed architecture. For more detailed information, you can refer to the official documentation on TiDB\\'s encoding rules: [Troubleshoot Hotspot Issues](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/troubleshoot-hot-spot-issues)..\\n2. Use the mok tool as follows: To decode values in TiDB using the `mok` tool, follow these steps. This guide will help you understand how to use the `mok` tool effectively for decoding tasks.\\n\\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Using the `mok` Tool\\n\\n1. **Install the `mok` Tool**:\\n   - Ensure that the `mok` tool is installed on your system. You can typically find installation instructions in the official TiDB documentation or the tool\\'s repository.\\n\\n2. **Prepare Your Environment**:\\n   - Make sure you have access to the TiDB cluster and the necessary permissions to perform decoding operations.\\n   - Ensure that your environment variables are set up correctly, including paths to any required binaries or libraries.\\n\\n3. **Identify the Data to Decode**:\\n   - Determine the specific data you need to decode. This could be row keys, index keys, or values stored in TiDB.\\n   - Gather the encoded data that you want to decode. This data is usually in a binary or base64 format.\\n\\n4. **Use the `mok` Tool for Decoding**:\\n   - Open your terminal or command-line interface.\\n   - Use the `mok` command to decode the data. The command syntax will depend on the type of data you are decoding (e.g., row keys, index keys, or values).\\n\\n   Example command for decoding a row key:\\n   ```shell\\n   mok decode --key \"t\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x1c_r\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\xfa\"\\n   ```\\n\\n   Example command for decoding a value:\\n   ```shell\\n   mok decode --value \"AhZoZWxsbyB3b3JsZAiAEA==\"\\n   ```\\n\\n5. **Interpret the Decoded Output**:\\n   - After running the decode command, the `mok` tool will output the decoded data in a human-readable format.\\n   - Review the output to understand the structure and content of the decoded data, such as table IDs, row IDs, or specific field values.\\n\\n6. **Verify the Decoded Data**:\\n   - Cross-check the decoded data with your expectations or other data sources to ensure accuracy.\\n   - If necessary, repeat the decoding process for additional data or different encoding formats.\\n\\n7. **Troubleshoot Common Issues**:\\n   - If you encounter errors, verify that the encoded data is correct and that you are using the appropriate command syntax.\\n   - Consult the `mok` tool documentation or support resources for troubleshooting tips and additional command options.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on using TiDB tools, you can refer to the official TiDB documentation at [TiDB Tools Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.2/ecosystem-tool-user-guide).\\n\\nBy following these steps, you should be able to effectively decode values in TiDB using the `mok` tool..', 'reasoning': None, 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': 'To decode a value in TiDB using the `mok` tool, we will follow these steps: 1.

PD 如何通过心跳机制判定节点故障\\n\\nPD(Placement Driver)是 TiDB 集群中负责元数据管理和调度的关键组件。它通过与 TiKV 节点定期交换心跳信息来检测节点的健康状况。每个 TiKV 节点都会定期发送心跳信号给 PD,包含其状态和当前信息(如副本信息、存储使用情况等)。如果 PD 在一定时间内未收到某个节点的心跳,便会判定该节点可能宕机或网络不通,这时会标记该节点为不可用,并开始相应的故障处理流程。\\n\\n### 2. Raft 组如何触发 leader 选举与副本状态变更\\n\\nTiDB 使用 Raft 协议来保证数据的一致性。在一个 Raft 组内,会有一个被选举为 leader 的节点,其他节点为 follower。当 leader 节点故障时,剩余的节点通过选举来确定新的 leader。当某个 follower 检测到与 leader 的心跳超时,它会触发 leader 选举过程。选举通过投票方式选出新的 leader,以确保集群的持续服务能力。同时,伴随着选举的过程,副本的状态也可能发生变更,例如 follower 变为 leader。\\n\\n### 3. 副本迁移过程中 down-peer 的计数变化\\n\\n当某个节点故障或需要维护时,可能会触发副本的迁移。副本迁移是指将数据从故障节点移动到健康节点上。在迁移过程中,down-peer(即下线副本)的计数会经历一个变化过程:\\n- 初始阶段,当节点故障时,down-peer 计数会增加,因为有副本无法正常访问。\\n- 迁移启动后,随着数据复制到新节点,down-peer 计数会减少。\\n- 复制完成后,新的节点可提供相应服务,此时 down-peer 计数应恢复到正常水平,即减少至零。\\n\\n### 4. 明确回答『副本完全迁移成功后 down-peer 数量会减少』是否成立,并说明最终稳定状态下的状态数据\\n\\n该命题是成立的。在副本完成迁移后,所有故障的副本都被新的健康副本替代,故而 down-peer 的数量会下降到零。同时,集群恢复到一个新的稳定状态,所有副本都可正常访问。此时,集群的每个节点状态都是健康的,PD 再次能收到所有心跳信号,从而确保集群的整体健康。\\n\\n综合来看,这一机制保证了 TiDB 的高可用性和数据一致性,即使在部分节点故障时,集群也能通过自动化的选举和迁移过程快速恢复正常服务。\\n\\n实操验证案例:\\n下面我将以一个实际案例详细说明 TiDB 集群在节点物理故障后的处理过程,包括副本调度和迁移的全过程。\\n\\n### 案例场景\\n\\n假设在某个 TiDB 集群中,有一个 TiKV 节点出现了物理故障,导致该节点无法对外提供服务。\\n\\n#### 1. 节点物理故障发生\\n\\n某一天,一个 TiKV 节点(例如节点 A)突然发生硬件故障,无法发送心跳信号给 PD。这一故障可能是由于机器宕机、硬盘损坏等物理原因。\\n\\n#### 2. PD 调度新副本创建时间线\\n\\n- **故障发现阶段**:PD 在一段心跳超时检测周期后(通常秒级到分钟级,根据集群配置),判定节点 A 故障。Prometheus 的监控图表会显示 down-peer 指标上升,因为集群中的一些 Region 的副本无法访问。\\n\\n- **调度启动阶段**:PD 开始调度新副本。在此阶段,它会选择一个健康的 TiKV 节点(例如节点 B)来作为新的副本所在地,并开始数据复制的准备工作。\\n\\n#### 3. Raft 组移除旧副本的时间点\\n\\n- **迁移执行阶段**:节点 B 开始从现有健康的副本拉取数据,并同步历史日志。Raft 组在某个时刻同意移除节点 A 中的旧副本。这个过程需要确保新的副本完成必要的日志复制,以便达到数据一致性。\\n\\n- **副本替换阶段**:一旦数据复制完成,节点 B 成为新的正式副本,而节点 A 被彻底移除出副本列表。\\n\\n#### 4. Prometheus 监控图表中的 down-peer 指标的5个关键变化阶段\\n\\n1. **正常状态**:最初,所有节点正常工作,down-peer 指标为 0。\\n\\n2. **故障触发阶段**:节点 A 故障,Prometheus 图表中 down-peer 指标开始上升,指示有不可访问的副本。\\n\\n3. **迁移开始阶段**:PD 调度新副本创建,down-peer 计数开始逐渐减少,显示数据从其他健康节点同步到节点 B 的过程。\\n\\n4. **迁移完成阶段**:数据复制完成后,节点 B 完全接替节点 A 的角色,down-peer 指标显著下降。\\n\\n5. **完全清理阶段**:所有旧副本被成功替换,监控图表中 down-peer 指标最终回到 0,表示所有副本都可用。\\n\\n### 总结\\n\\n在整个过程中,TiDB 集群通过 PD 的调度和 Raft 协议的协调,能够快速、自动地应对节点故障,保持数据的高可用性和一致性。最终,集群恢复到一个新的稳定状态,确保数据服务不中断。\\n\\n这种机制体现了 TiDB 的稳健性,即使在发生硬件故障时,集群也能够在较短时间内自动恢复到正常运营水平。', 'reasoning': None, 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': \"To address the user's question about TiDB's replica migration mechanism and the change in down-peer count, we need to understand how TiDB handles node failures and replica migrations using the Raft protocol.

The `IMPORT INTO` statement in TiDB only supports importing data into existing empty tables. This is a prerequisite to avoid any data conflicts during the import process.\\n\\n2. **Disable DDL and DML Operations**:\\n   - During the data import process, refrain from performing any Data Definition Language (DDL) or Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations on the target table. This includes operations like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and any schema changes. These operations can lead to import failures or data inconsistencies.\\n\\n3. **Avoid Read Operations**:\\n   - It is recommended not to perform read operations on the target table during the import process. The data being read might be inconsistent, and it is best to perform read and write operations only after the import is completed.\\n\\n4. **Use the `DETACHED` Option for Asynchronous Execution**:\\n   - If you want to execute the import operation asynchronously, you can add the `DETACHED` option to the `IMPORT INTO` statement. This allows the import to run in the background, freeing up the current connection for other tasks.\\n\\n5. **Monitor and Manage Import Jobs**:\\n   - Use task management statements such as `SHOW IMPORT JOB(s)` to monitor the status of import jobs. This helps in ensuring that the import process is running smoothly and allows you to take corrective actions if needed.\\n\\n6. **Ensure Sufficient Resources**:\\n   - The import process consumes significant system resources. For optimal performance, it is recommended to use TiDB nodes with at least 32 cores and 64 GiB of memory. Ensure that the TiDB temporary directory has sufficient space to handle the import data.\\n\\n7. **Check for Conflicts**:\\n   - Before starting the import, ensure that the data to be imported does not contain any records with primary key or non-null unique index conflicts. Such conflicts can result in import task failures.\\n\\n8. **Avoid Cluster Upgrades During Import**:\\n   - Do not perform TiDB cluster upgrades during the import process. This can disrupt the import operation and lead to failures.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can effectively prevent insert operations during a bulk import in TiDB, ensuring a smooth and consistent data import process.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the official TiDB documentation on the `IMPORT INTO` statement and its restrictions:\\n- [IMPORT INTO Documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/sql-statement-import-into)', 'reasoning': None, 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': \"To prevent insert operations during a bulk import in TiDB, we will explore methods involving transaction management and locking mechanisms.

This ensures that no data modifications occur during the import process, maintaining data integrity and consistency.\\n\\n### Step-by-Step Guide\\n\\n1. **Enable Read-Only Mode**:\\n   - Use the `tidb_restricted_read_only` system variable to set the entire cluster to read-only mode. This will prevent any write operations such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.\\n\\n   ```sql\\n   SET GLOBAL tidb_restricted_read_only = ON;\\n   ```\\n\\n   - This command ensures that all TiDB servers in the cluster are in read-only mode. Only read operations like `SELECT`, `USE`, and `SHOW` are allowed.\\n\\n2. **Verify Read-Only Status**:\\n   - Check the status of the `tidb_restricted_read_only` variable to confirm that the cluster is in read-only mode.\\n\\n   ```sql\\n   SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'tidb_restricted_read_only';\\n   ```\\n\\n   - The output should show that the variable is set to `ON`.\\n\\n3. **Handle Uncommitted Transactions**:\\n   - Ensure that any uncommitted transactions are either committed or rolled back before enabling read-only mode. This prevents any pending write operations from being executed.\\n\\n4. **Grant Necessary Privileges**:\\n   - If certain users need to perform write operations despite the read-only setting, you can grant them the `RESTRICTED_REPLICA_WRITER_ADMIN` privilege. However, this should be done with caution and only if absolutely necessary.\\n\\n   ```sql\\n   GRANT RESTRICTED_REPLICA_WRITER_ADMIN ON *.* TO 'username'@'host';\\n   ```\\n\\n5. **Monitor the Cluster**:\\n   - Continuously monitor the cluster to ensure that no unauthorized write operations are attempted. Use TiDB's monitoring tools to track any anomalies.\\n\\n6. **Revert to Normal Mode After Import**:\\n   - Once the bulk import is complete, revert the cluster back to its normal operational mode by disabling the read-only setting.\\n\\n   ```sql\\n   SET GLOBAL tidb_restricted_read_only = OFF;\\n   ```\\n\\n   - Verify the change by checking the variable status again.\\n\\n### References\\n\\nFor more detailed information on the `tidb_restricted_read_only` variable and its usage, you can refer to the official TiDB documentation:\\n- [TiDB System Variables](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/system-variables)\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can effectively manage write operations in a shared TiDB cluster during a bulk import, ensuring data consistency and integrity.\", 'reasoning': None, 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': \"To prevent write operations in a shared TiDB cluster during a bulk import, we need to explore configurations and SQL commands that can effectively restrict INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.

This command is part of TiDB's dynamic configuration management, which allows users to view and modify configuration settings without needing to restart the cluster components.\\n\\n### Purpose of the Command\\nThe command specifically targets the `replication.max-replicas` configuration item within the PD component. This setting determines the total number of replicas for each data region in the TiDB cluster, including one leader and multiple followers. By default, this value is set to 3, meaning one leader and two followers. Adjusting this setting can help balance data redundancy and availability against resource usage.\\n\\n### Role of PD in Replication Settings\\nPD is a crucial component in the TiDB architecture responsible for managing cluster metadata, scheduling data placement, and ensuring even data distribution across TiKV nodes. It plays a significant role in replication by determining how many copies of each piece of data (replicas) should exist and where they should be located. This helps ensure data availability and fault tolerance within the cluster.\\n\\n### Configuration Management in TiDB\\nTiDB supports dynamic configuration management, allowing certain settings to be modified on-the-fly using SQL commands.

This command is part of TiDB's dynamic configuration management capabilities, which allow administrators to query and adjust settings without needing to restart the cluster components.\\n\\n### Purpose and Functionality\\n\\n1. **Configuration Query**: The command is designed to fetch the current value of the `replication.max-replicas` setting for PD. This parameter determines the number of replicas that should be maintained for each piece of data in the TiKV storage layer. By querying this setting, administrators can verify the current replication strategy being employed by the cluster.\\n\\n2. **Cluster Management**: Understanding the `replication.max-replicas` value is crucial for managing the cluster's data distribution and ensuring high availability. This setting directly impacts how data is replicated across TiKV nodes, which is essential for fault tolerance and data durability.\\n\\n3. **Operational Insight**: By using this command, administrators gain insight into the replication configuration, which can inform decisions about resource allocation and load balancing. It helps in assessing whether the current replication strategy aligns with the desired level of data redundancy and availability.\\n\\n### Integration within TiDB's Framework\\n\\n- **Role of PD**: As the central management component, PD oversees the distribution of data and the scheduling of tasks across the cluster. The `replication.max-replicas` setting is a key part of PD's responsibilities, as it dictates how many copies of each data item are maintained, influencing both performance and resilience.\\n\\n- **Dynamic Configuration**: TiDB's ability to dynamically query and adjust configurations like `replication.max-replicas` without downtime is a significant advantage. It allows for real-time adjustments to the cluster's operational parameters, ensuring that the system can adapt to changing workloads and conditions.\\n\\n- **High Availability and Fault Tolerance**: By managing replication settings, PD enhances the cluster's ability to withstand node failures and maintain service continuity. The `replication.max-replicas` parameter is central to this capability, as it ensures that sufficient replicas are available to recover from hardware or network failures.\\n\\nIn summary, the `SHOW CONFIG WHERE type='pd' AND name='replication.max-replicas'` command is a valuable tool for administrators to monitor and manage the replication configuration of a TiDB cluster. It provides critical insights into the cluster's data redundancy strategy, supporting high availability and fault tolerance.

Você pode acessar o site oficial para verificar as taxas diárias.\\n\\n2. **Sites de Finanças e Economia**: Portais como Bloomberg, Reuters, e Yahoo Finanças frequentemente atualizam as taxas de câmbio e oferecem análises econômicas.\\n\\n3. **Aplicativos de Conversão de Moeda**: Aplicativos como XE Currency e OANDA também são fontes confiáveis para verificar taxas de câmbio em tempo real.\\n\\nEssas fontes são amplamente reconhecidas por fornecerem dados precisos e atualizados sobre taxas de câmbio. Para armazenar e processar dados de taxa de câmbio em TiDB, você pode seguir os passos abaixo, que incluem a criação de tabelas, inserção de dados e execução de consultas SQL. TiDB é um banco de dados distribuído que oferece compatibilidade com MySQL, o que facilita a integração com aplicações existentes.\\n\\n### 1. Criação de Tabelas\\n\\nPrimeiro, você precisa criar uma tabela para armazenar as taxas de câmbio. Aqui está um exemplo de como você pode definir essa tabela:\\n\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE taxas_cambio (\\n    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,\\n    moeda_origem VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL,\\n    moeda_destino VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL,\\n    taxa DECIMAL(18, 6) NOT NULL,\\n    data DATE NOT NULL,\\n    UNIQUE KEY (moeda_origem, moeda_destino, data)\\n);\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Inserção de Dados\\n\\nApós criar a tabela, você pode inserir dados de taxa de câmbio. Aqui está um exemplo de inserção de dados:\\n\\n```sql\\nINSERT INTO taxas_cambio (moeda_origem, moeda_destino, taxa, data) VALUES\\n('USD', 'EUR', 0.85, '2023-10-01'),\\n('EUR', 'USD', 1.18, '2023-10-01'),\\n('USD', 'BRL', 5.25, '2023-10-01');\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Consultas SQL\\n\\nPara consultar as taxas de câmbio, você pode usar consultas SQL como as seguintes:\\n\\n- **Consultar a taxa de câmbio mais recente entre duas moedas:**\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT taxa FROM taxas_cambio\\nWHERE moeda_origem = 'USD' AND moeda_destino = 'EUR'\\nORDER BY data DESC\\nLIMIT 1;\\n```\\n\\n- **Consultar todas as taxas de câmbio para uma data específica:**\\n\\n```sql\\nSELECT moeda_origem, moeda_destino, taxa FROM taxas_cambio\\nWHERE data = '2023-10-01';\\n```\\n\\n### 4. Integração com Aplicações\\n\\nPara integrar o TiDB com suas aplicações, você pode usar drivers MySQL, já que TiDB é compatível com o protocolo MySQL. Isso significa que qualquer aplicação que já se conecta a um banco de dados MySQL pode ser facilmente adaptada para se conectar ao TiDB.\\n\\n- **Linguagens de Programação**: Use bibliotecas e drivers MySQL disponíveis para linguagens como Python, Java, Node.js, etc.\\n- **Ferramentas de ETL**: Utilize ferramentas de ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) para automatizar a importação de dados de taxas de câmbio de APIs externas para o TiDB.\\n\\n### Considerações Finais\\n\\n- **Escalabilidade**: Aproveite a escalabilidade horizontal do TiDB para lidar com grandes volumes de dados de taxas de câmbio.\\n- **Consistência**: Utilize as funcionalidades de transações ACID do TiDB para garantir a consistência dos dados.\\n\\nEssas práticas ajudarão a garantir que você possa armazenar e processar dados de taxa de câmbio de forma eficiente e escalável usando o TiDB.\", 'reasoning': None, 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': 'The goal is to find the current exchange rate of 1 US dollar to Brazilian real.

Each of these consensus mechanisms has its own strengths and weaknesses, which make them suitable for different use cases in distributed systems.\\n\\n### Performance Comparison\\n\\n#### TiDB's Multi-Raft Protocol\\n1. **Data Replication and Consistency**: Multi-Raft uses multiple Raft groups to manage data replication, which allows for parallel processing and can improve throughput compared to a single Raft group. This setup ensures strong consistency across distributed nodes.\\n   \\n2. **Scalability**: Multi-Raft supports horizontal scalability by distributing data across multiple nodes and regions, which helps balance the load and improve performance. This is particularly beneficial for large-scale systems.\\n\\n3. **Latency**: While Multi-Raft provides strong consistency, it can be affected by network latency, especially in cross-region deployments. The need for majority voting can introduce delays in write operations.\\n\\n4. **Concurrency and Load Handling**: The protocol is designed to handle high concurrency and large data volumes efficiently, supporting distributed transactions and load balancing.\\n\\n#### Paxos\\n1. **Latency**: Paxos can introduce significant latency due to its multi-phase nature, requiring multiple rounds of communication to reach consensus. This can be a bottleneck in wide-area networks.\\n\\n2. **Throughput**: The need for multiple message exchanges and majority agreement can limit throughput, especially in systems with high transaction rates.\\n\\n3. **Scalability**: Paxos is less scalable compared to Multi-Raft, as the communication overhead increases with the number of nodes, leading to higher latency and reduced throughput.\\n\\n#### Single Raft\\n1. **Log Application Optimization**: Single Raft can optimize performance by applying logs after quorum peers have persisted them, reducing write latency.\\n\\n2. **Concurrency and Resource Management**: Features like Hibernate Region and Region Merge help manage resources efficiently, optimizing performance.\\n\\n3. **Latency**: Similar to Multi-Raft, single Raft can be affected by network latency, particularly in geo-distributed setups.\\n\\n### Reliability Comparison\\n\\n#### TiDB's Multi-Raft Protocol\\n1. **Fault Tolerance**: Multi-Raft enhances fault tolerance by replicating data across multiple nodes. It can continue operating despite node failures, ensuring high availability.\\n\\n2. **Disaster Recovery**: The protocol supports robust disaster recovery by leveraging multiple availability zones and regions.\\n\\n3. **Automatic Failover**: Leader election in Raft allows for automatic failover, maintaining service availability.\\n\\n4. **Data Safety**: Majority consensus before committing changes ensures data safety and consistency.\\n\\n#### Paxos\\n1. **Fault Tolerance**: Paxos is highly reliable, tolerating failures of a minority of nodes. It can continue functioning as long as a majority of nodes are operational.\\n\\n2. **Consistency**: Paxos guarantees strong consistency, ensuring a consistent view of data across nodes.\\n\\n3. **Leader Election**: While Paxos includes leader election, the leader can become a single point of failure, potentially causing temporary unavailability.\\n\\n#### Single Raft\\n1. **Fault Tolerance**: Raft ensures data consistency and high availability by replicating data across nodes and requiring majority agreement for writes.\\n\\n2. **Leader Election and Membership Changes**: Raft handles these efficiently, ensuring system operation despite node failures.\\n\\n3. **Log Replication and Snapshot Management**: Raft maintains data consistency through log replication and snapshot management, supporting reliable data recovery.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\n- **TiDB's Multi-Raft Protocol**: Offers strong consistency, fault tolerance, and scalability, making it suitable for applications requiring high availability and disaster recovery. However, network latency and deployment architecture need careful consideration.\\n\\n- **Paxos**: Provides strong consistency and fault tolerance, ideal for critical systems. Its complexity and performance overhead can be limiting, especially in high-transaction or large-node environments.\\n\\n- **Single Raft**: Balances performance and reliability, with optimizations for log application and resource management. It is a robust choice for distributed data systems but requires tuning for optimal performance in geo-distributed deployments.\\n\\nEach protocol has its niche, and the choice depends on specific system requirements, such as consistency, availability, scalability, and network conditions.\", 'reasoning': None, 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': \"To compare TiDB's Multi-Raft protocol with other consensus algorithms in terms of performance and reliability, we will break down the goal into several sub-tasks: 1.

Understand the encoding mechanism: TiDB uses a sophisticated encoding mechanism to store table and index data as key-value pairs in its underlying storage engine, TiKV. This encoding ensures that data is stored in an ordered manner, which is crucial for efficient data retrieval and processing.\\n\\n### Table Data Encoding\\n- **Table ID and Row ID**: Each table is assigned a unique `TableID`, and each row within a table is assigned a unique `RowID`. If a table has an integer primary key, TiDB optimizes by using the primary key value as the `RowID`.\\n- **Key-Value Pair Structure**: Each row of data is encoded into a key-value pair. The key is constructed using the format `tablePrefix{TableID}_recordPrefixSep{RowID}`, and the value contains the row\\'s column data.\\n- **String Constants**: `tablePrefix` and `recordPrefixSep` are special string constants used to distinguish table data in the key space.\\n\\n### Index Data Encoding\\n- **Index ID**: Each index is assigned a unique `IndexID`.\\n- **Primary and Unique Indexes**: For primary keys and unique indexes, the key is encoded as `tablePrefix{tableID}_indexPrefixSep{indexID}_indexedColumnsValue`, and the value is the `RowID`.\\n- **Non-Unique Indexes**: For non-unique indexes, the key is encoded as `tablePrefix{TableID}_indexPrefixSep{IndexID}_indexedColumnsValue_{RowID}`, and the value is `null`.\\n\\n### Example\\nConsider a table `User` with a primary key `ID` and a secondary index `idxAge`. The table data and index data are stored in TiKV as follows:\\n- **Table Data**: \\n  - `t10_r1` maps to `[\"TiDB\", \"SQL Layer\", 10]`\\n  - `t10_r2` maps to `[\"TiKV\", \"KV Engine\", 20]`\\n  - `t10_r3` maps to `[\"PD\", \"Manager\", 30]`\\n- **Index Data**:\\n  - `t10_i1_10_1` maps to `null`\\n  - `t10_i1_20_2` maps to `null`\\n  - `t10_i1_30_3` maps to `null`\\n\\nThis encoding scheme ensures that all rows in a table and all data of an index are stored sequentially in TiKV\\'s key space, facilitating efficient range queries and data retrieval.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [TiDB Computing documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-computing)..\\n2. Use the mok tool as follows: To decode values in TiDB using the `tidb-ctl` tool, follow these steps. This guide will help you understand how to use the `decoder` command to decode row keys, index keys, and values in a human-readable format.\\n\\n### Step-by-Step Guide\\n\\n1. **Install TiDB Control Tool**: \\n   - Ensure that you have the `tidb-ctl` tool installed on your system. This tool is part of the TiDB ecosystem and is used for various administrative tasks.\\n\\n2. **Prepare Your Environment**:\\n   - Before decoding, make sure your environment is set up correctly. You should have access to the TiDB server and the necessary permissions to execute commands.\\n\\n3. **Decode Row Keys**:\\n   - Use the `decoder` command to decode row keys. This command helps you extract table IDs and row IDs from encoded keys.\\n   - Example command:\\n     ```shell\\n     ./tidb-ctl decoder \"t\\\\\\\\x00\\\\\\\\x00\\\\\\\\x00\\\\\\\\x00\\\\\\\\x00\\\\\\\\x00\\\\\\\\x00\\\\\\\\x1c_r\\\\\\\\x00\\\\\\\\x00\\\\\\\\x00\\\\\\\\x00\\\\\\\\x00\\\\\\\\x00\\\\\\\\x00\\\\\\\\xfa\"\\n     ```\\n   - The output will display the format, table ID, and row ID in a human-readable format.\\n\\n4. **Decode Index Keys**:\\n   - Similar to row keys, you can decode index keys using the same `decoder` command.\\n   - Example command:\\n     ```shell\\n     ./tidb-ctl decoder \"encoded_index_key_here\"\\n     ```\\n   - This will output the index key details, including the index type and values.\\n\\n5. **Decode Values**:\\n   - To decode values, use the `decoder` command with the encoded value.\\n   - Example command:\\n     ```shell\\n     ./tidb-ctl decoder AhZoZWxsbyB3b3JsZAiAEA==\\n     ```\\n   - The output will show the format and the decoded values, such as data types and their corresponding values.\\n\\n6. **Reference for More Information**:\\n   - For more detailed instructions and examples, you can refer to the official TiDB documentation: [TiDB Control User Guide](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tidb-control).\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can effectively decode various keys and values in TiDB using the `tidb-ctl` tool.

Here’s how to do it:\\n\\n1. **Decoding Row Keys**:\\n   If you have a row key that you want to decode, use the following command:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   tidb-ctl decoder \"<encoded_row_key>\"\\n   ```\\n\\n   Replace `<encoded_row_key>` with your actual encoded row key. For example:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   tidb-ctl decoder \"t\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x1c_r\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\xfa\"\\n   ```\\n\\n   This will output the decoded format, table ID, and row ID.\\n\\n2. **Decoding Values**:\\n   If you have a base64 encoded value, you can decode it using:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   tidb-ctl decoder <base64_encoded_value>\\n   ```\\n\\n   For example:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   tidb-ctl decoder \"AhZoZWxsbyB3b3JsZAiAEA==\"\\n   ```\\n\\n   This will provide you with the decoded value and its type.\\n\\n### Step 4: Review the Output\\nAfter executing the commands, review the output provided by the `tidb-ctl decoder`. It will show you the decoded information, including the format, type, and actual values.\\n\\n### Step 5: Additional Commands\\nYou can also explore other commands available in `tidb-ctl` for more functionalities, such as obtaining schema information or working with etcd.\\n\\n### References\\nFor more detailed information on using TiDB Control and its commands, you can refer to the official documentation: [TiDB Control User Guide](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/tidb-control). \\n\\nBy following these steps, you should be able to effectively decode values in TiDB using the `mok` tool..', 'reasoning': None, 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': \"To decode a value in TiDB using the 'mok' tool, we need to first verify if 'mok' is the correct tool for this task.

Additionally, In TiDB, the TimeStamp Oracle (TSO) is a crucial component managed by the Placement Driver (PD). The TSO provides globally unique and monotonically increasing timestamps, which are essential for transaction ordering and maintaining data consistency across the distributed database system. The TSO consists of two parts: a physical timestamp and a logical counter. The physical timestamp is a UNIX timestamp in milliseconds, while the logical counter is used to handle multiple requests within the same millisecond.\\n\\nConverting a regular timestamp to a TSO value is not directly supported in TiDB due to several architectural reasons:\\n\\n1. **Role of the PD**: The PD is responsible for generating TSOs, ensuring that they are unique and monotonically increasing across the entire cluster. This centralized control is necessary to maintain consistency and avoid conflicts in a distributed environment. Allowing arbitrary conversion of timestamps to TSO values could undermine this consistency, as it would bypass the PD's control.\\n\\n2. **Logical Counter**: The TSO includes a logical counter that increments with each request within the same millisecond. This counter is crucial for maintaining the order of transactions that occur at the same physical time. A simple conversion from a timestamp would not account for this logical component, potentially leading to conflicts or incorrect transaction ordering.\\n\\n3. **Consistency and Integrity**: TiDB's architecture is designed to ensure that TSOs are always moving forward and never regress. This is vital for maintaining the integrity of the database's transaction history. Allowing external conversion of timestamps to TSOs could introduce the risk of generating TSOs that do not adhere to this forward-only progression, leading to potential data inconsistencies.\\n\\n4. **System Design**: The design of TiDB is such that TSOs are generated as part of the transaction lifecycle, ensuring that each transaction has a unique and consistent temporal marker. This design does not accommodate external generation or conversion of timestamps into TSOs, as it would disrupt the tightly controlled process managed by the PD.\\n\\nFor these reasons, TiDB does not support direct conversion of timestamps to TSO values. The TSO generation process is integral to the system's architecture and is tightly controlled to ensure consistency and reliability across the distributed database.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on how TSOs work in TiDB, you can refer to the official documentation: [TimeStamp Oracle (TSO) in TiDB](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tso)..\", 'reasoning': None, 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': 'To convert a timestamp to a TSO value in TiDB, we need to understand the structure of a TSO and how TiDB generates it.

In TiDB, the physical timestamp occupies the higher bits, and the logical counter occupies the lower bits of the TSO value.\\n\\nUnfortunately, there is no direct SQL function in TiDB to convert a regular timestamp to a TSO value. However, you can manually perform the conversion using the steps above and the bitwise operations to combine the physical timestamp and logical counter.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on TSO and its structure in TiDB, you can refer to the official documentation: [TimeStamp Oracle (TSO) in TiDB](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tso).. Additionally, Converting a timestamp to a TSO (Timestamp Oracle) value in TiDB is not directly feasible due to the architectural design and the role of the Placement Driver (PD) in TiDB. Here are some reasons why this conversion might not be directly supported:\\n\\n1. **TSO Structure**: A TSO in TiDB is composed of two parts: a physical timestamp and a logical counter. The physical timestamp is a UNIX timestamp in milliseconds, while the logical counter is used to ensure uniqueness when multiple TSOs are generated within the same millisecond. This structure means that a simple timestamp does not contain the logical counter information necessary to form a complete TSO value.\\n\\n2. **Role of the Placement Driver (PD)**: The PD is responsible for generating TSOs in TiDB. It ensures that TSOs are globally unique and monotonically increasing across the distributed system. This centralization is crucial for maintaining consistency and ordering in distributed transactions. Since the PD manages TSO generation, converting a standalone timestamp to a TSO would bypass the PD's control, potentially leading to inconsistencies.\\n\\n3. **Architectural Limitations**: TiDB's architecture is designed to handle distributed transactions with strong consistency guarantees. Allowing arbitrary conversion of timestamps to TSOs could undermine these guarantees, as it would not account for the logical counter or the centralized control by the PD.\\n\\n4. **Use of TSO in Transactions**: TSOs are integral to transaction management in TiDB, particularly for Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC). They are used to order transactions and ensure that reads and writes are consistent across the cluster. Converting a timestamp to a TSO without the PD's involvement could disrupt this ordering.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on how TSOs are used in TiDB and the role of the PD, you can refer to the following sources:\\n- [TimeStamp Oracle (TSO) in TiDB](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tso)\\n- [PD Microservices](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/pd-microservices). If direct conversion is not feasible, consider these alternatives: To achieve a similar outcome in TiDB, you can utilize the Timestamp Oracle (TSO) feature, which is crucial for transaction ordering and maintaining data consistency in distributed databases like TiDB. TSO provides globally unique and monotonically increasing timestamps, which are essential for operations such as transaction management and data replication.\\n\\n### Key Points about TSO in TiDB:\\n\\n1. **TSO Allocation**: In TiDB, the Placement Driver (PD) is responsible for allocating TSO timestamps. These timestamps are used to assign temporal markers to transactions and data, supporting Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) and transaction management. You can learn more about TSO in TiDB from the [official documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tso).\\n\\n2. **TSO Structure**: A TSO timestamp consists of two parts:\\n   - **Physical Timestamp**: A UNIX timestamp in milliseconds since 1 January 1970.\\n   - **Logical Counter**: An incrementing counter used when multiple timestamps are needed within the same millisecond.\\n\\n3. **Retrieving TSO**: You can retrieve the current TSO in TiDB using SQL commands. For example:\\n   ```sql\\n   BEGIN; \\n   SET @ts := @@tidb_current_ts; \\n   ROLLBACK;\\n   SELECT @ts;\\n   ```\\n   This command sequence is executed within a transaction because TSO timestamps are assigned per transaction.\\n\\n4. **Parsing TSO**: TiDB provides functions to parse TSO timestamps:\\n   - `TIDB_PARSE_TSO()`: Extracts the physical timestamp.\\n   - `TIDB_PARSE_TSO_LOGICAL()`: Extracts the logical part of the TSO.\\n\\n5. **Performance Considerations**: TSO requests can impact performance, especially in high-concurrency scenarios. TiDB offers features like `tidb_rc_read_check_ts` to optimize read performance by reducing TSO requests.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on TSO and its usage in TiDB, you can refer to the [TiDB documentation on TSO](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tso).\\n\\nBy understanding and utilizing these features, you can effectively manage transaction ordering and data consistency in TiDB, similar to other distributed database systems..\", 'reasoning': None, 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': 'To convert a timestamp to a TSO value in TiDB, we need to understand the structure of a TSO and how TiDB generates it.

Here's a detailed explanation and a comparison table to illustrate these differences:\\n\\n### Explanation\\n\\n1. **Pricing Model**:\\n   - **TiDB Serverless** uses a Request Unit (RU) pricing model, which charges based on the actual resource consumption of queries and transactions. This model is particularly cost-effective for workloads with variable demand, as users only pay for what they use. Additionally, TiDB Serverless offers a generous free tier, which includes 5 GiB of row-based storage, 5 GiB of columnar storage, and 50 million RUs per month for the first five clusters. This can significantly reduce costs for small-scale projects or initial exploration phases. [Source](https://www.pingcap.com/tidb-serverless-pricing-details/)\\n   - **MySQL RDS**, on the other hand, follows an instance-based pricing model, where users pay for the provisioned resources (compute and storage) regardless of actual usage. This can lead to higher costs, especially if resources are over-provisioned to handle peak loads.\\n\\n2. **Scalability and Resource Management**:\\n   - **TiDB Serverless** automatically scales resources based on workload demands, optimizing resource usage and reducing costs. This dynamic scaling means that users do not need to over-provision resources, which is particularly beneficial for applications with fluctuating workloads. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/serverless-faqs)\\n   - **MySQL RDS** requires manual scaling and management of instance types, which can result in inefficiencies and higher costs if not managed properly.\\n\\n3. **Storage Optimization**:\\n   - **TiDB Serverless** supports columnar storage, which is optimized for analytical queries. This can be more cost-effective for running analytics compared to traditional row-based storage, as it reduces computational costs. Running analytic queries on columnar storage can be about one-third of the cost compared to row-based storage. [Source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/serverless-faqs)\\n   - **MySQL RDS** primarily uses row-based storage, which is optimized for transactional workloads and does not natively support columnar storage or HTAP capabilities.\\n\\n### Comparison Table\\n\\n| Feature/Aspect                  | TiDB Serverless                                      | MySQL RDS                                      |\\n|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\\n| **Pricing Model**               | Request Unit (RU) based, pay-as-you-go               | Instance-based, pay for provisioned resources  |\\n| **Free Tier**                   | Yes, includes 5 GiB row storage, 5 GiB columnar storage, and 50 million RUs per month | No equivalent free tier                        |\\n| **Scalability**                 | Automatic, based on workload demands                 | Manual, requires user intervention             |\\n| **Storage Type**                | Row-based and columnar (HTAP support)                | Primarily row-based (InnoDB)                   |\\n| **Cost Efficiency**             | Up to 70% cheaper due to dynamic scaling and RU model | Higher costs due to fixed resource provisioning|\\n\\nIn summary, TiDB Serverless offers a more flexible and cost-effective solution compared to MySQL RDS, particularly for applications with variable workloads and analytical needs.

These methods are designed to minimize disruption to ongoing operations and maintain data consistency. However, there are certain limitations when it comes to altering schema objects, such as changing a clustered primary key.\\n\\n1. **Unsupported Alter Operations**: TiDB does not support certain alter operations, such as adding or dropping a clustered primary key. This is due to the complexity and potential impact on data consistency and performance. For more details on the limitations of DDL operations in TiDB compared to MySQL, you can refer to the [MySQL Compatibility](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/mysql-compatibility) documentation.\\n\\n2. **Changefeed Approach**: While TiDB's changefeed feature, powered by TiCDC, allows for streaming data changes to other systems, it does not directly support altering schema objects like changing a clustered primary key. Changefeeds are primarily used for data replication and streaming to downstream systems such as Apache Kafka, MySQL, or cloud storage. For more information on changefeeds, you can visit the [Changefeed Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/ticdc-changefeed-overview) page.\\n\\n3. **Alternative Solutions**: If you need to perform an unsupported alter operation, you might consider a workaround involving data migration. This could involve creating a new table with the desired schema, migrating data from the old table to the new one, and then switching application logic to use the new table. This approach, however, requires careful planning to ensure data consistency and minimal downtime.\\n\\nIn summary, while TiDB offers robust tools for online schema changes, certain operations like altering a clustered primary key are not supported directly. For such cases, alternative strategies like data migration might be necessary.

This capability can be leveraged to synchronize data between tables with different schemas, effectively working around unsupported alter operations by creating a new table with the desired schema and using changefeeds to keep it updated with changes from the original table.\\n\\n### Potential Challenges\\n\\n1. **Data Consistency**: Ensuring data consistency between the source and target tables is crucial. Changefeeds must be configured correctly to capture all relevant changes, including inserts, updates, and deletes.\\n\\n2. **Schema Compatibility**: Changefeeds may encounter issues if there are schema compatibility problems, such as when a schema change in the source table is not compatible with the target table's schema. This can lead to errors or data loss.\\n\\n3. **Performance Overhead**: The additional overhead of maintaining changefeeds can impact performance, especially in high-throughput environments. It is important to monitor and optimize the performance of changefeeds to minimize latency and resource usage.\\n\\n4. **Handling Unsupported Operations**: Some operations, like certain types of schema changes, may not be fully supported by changefeeds. In such cases, additional logic may be needed to handle these operations manually.\\n\\n### Solutions and Best Practices\\n\\n1. **Use of Sync Points**: Implement sync points to ensure that the target table is transactionally consistent with the source table. This involves periodically setting consistent snapshot points that have been replicated to the target table.\\n\\n2. **Configuration Management**: Carefully configure changefeeds to handle specific data types and operations. For example, use filters to exclude unsupported operations or data that should not be replicated.\\n\\n3. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up monitoring and alerts to detect and respond to any issues with changefeeds promptly. This includes monitoring replication latency, error rates, and resource usage.\\n\\n4. **Testing and Validation**: Before deploying changefeeds in a production environment, conduct thorough testing to validate that the synchronization works as expected and that data consistency is maintained.\\n\\n5. **Documentation and Training**: Ensure that all team members involved in managing changefeeds are well-trained and have access to comprehensive documentation on how to configure and troubleshoot changefeeds.\\n\\n### References\\n\\nFor more detailed information on setting up and managing changefeeds in TiDB, you can refer to the following resources:\\n\\n- [Sink to Cloud Storage](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/changefeed-sink-to-cloud-storage)\\n- [TiCDC Avro Protocol](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/ticdc-avro-protocol)\\n- [CLI and Configuration Parameters of TiCDC Changefeeds](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/ticdc-changefeed-config)\\n- [Manage Changefeeds](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/ticdc-manage-changefeed)\\n\\nThese resources provide insights into the configuration, management, and troubleshooting of changefeeds, which are essential for implementing a successful changefeed-based workaround.\", 'reasoning': None, 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': \"To effectively evaluate the feasibility of using changefeed for unsupported alter operations in TiDB, we need comprehensive information on TiDB's changefeed features, possible solutions for syncing data between tables with different schemas, and their limitations.\"}, 'seq_no': 0, 'type': 'reasoning'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['changefeed_features'], 'tool_name': 'retrieve_knowledge_graph', 'tool_params': {'query': 'TiDB changefeed features, capabilities, and limitations for synchronizing data between tables with different schemas'}}, 'seq_no': 1, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['sync_solutions_info'], 'tool_name': 'vector_search', 'tool_params': {'query': 'Solutions and limitations for synchronizing data between tables with different schemas using TiDB changefeed', 'top_k': 10}}, 'seq_no': 2, 'type': 'calling'}, {'parameters': {'output_vars': ['workaround_analysis'], 'tool_name': 'llm_generate', 'tool_params': {'context': 'Changefeed Features: ${changefeed_features}\\nSync Solutions Information: ${sync_solutions_info}', 'prompt': 'Evaluate the practicality and challenges of implementing a changefeed-based workaround in TiDB for unsupported alter operations.

A potential workaround involves using changefeeds to replicate data to a new table with the desired schema changes. This approach leverages TiCDC to capture changes from the original table and apply them to a new table with the updated schema. However, this method has limitations, such as the need for a valid primary key or non-null unique index to avoid data duplication during replication. Additionally, changefeeds are not available for TiDB Cloud Serverless clusters, and there are restrictions on the number of changefeeds per cluster [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/changefeed-sink-to-cloud-storage).\\n\\nWhen comparing this changefeed-based workaround to tools like gh-ost and pt-osc, several factors should be considered:\\n\\n1. **Complexity and Overhead**: Tools like gh-ost and pt-osc are designed specifically for online schema changes and handle the complexities of altering tables without downtime. They manage the creation of shadow tables, data copying, and cutover processes automatically. In contrast, using changefeeds requires manual setup and management of the replication process, which can be more complex and error-prone.\\n\\n2. **Data Consistency**: gh-ost and pt-osc ensure data consistency during the schema change process by applying changes incrementally and synchronizing the shadow table with the original table before the final cutover. Changefeeds can also maintain data consistency, but they require careful configuration to ensure that all changes are captured and applied correctly.\\n\\n3. **Performance Impact**: Both gh-ost and pt-osc are optimized to minimize the performance impact on the source database during schema changes. Changefeeds, while efficient, may introduce additional load on the system, especially if the replication involves large volumes of data or complex transformations.\\n\\n4. **Flexibility**: Changefeeds offer flexibility in terms of data transformation and integration with other systems, as they can stream data to various destinations like cloud storage or message queues. However, for the specific task of altering a clustered primary key, this flexibility may not provide significant advantages over dedicated schema change tools.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while a changefeed-based workaround is feasible for altering a clustered primary key in TiDB, it may not be the most efficient or straightforward solution compared to using tools like gh-ost and pt-osc. These tools are specifically designed for online schema changes and offer a more streamlined and reliable process.

This step involves defining the new table structure manually.\\n\\n3. **Data Synchronization**: Use the changefeed to continuously replicate data from the original table to the new table. This ensures that the new table remains up-to-date with all changes occurring in the original table.\\n\\n4. **Switch Over**: Once the data is fully synchronized and verified, switch the application to use the new table. This might involve renaming tables or updating application configurations to point to the new table.\\n\\n### Comparison with gh-ost and pt-osc\\n\\n- **gh-ost and pt-osc**: These tools are designed specifically for online schema changes in MySQL-compatible databases. They work by creating a shadow table, applying changes, and then switching over with minimal downtime. They handle data consistency and integrity checks automatically.\\n\\n- **Changefeed Approach**: While TiDB's changefeed can replicate data changes, it requires manual intervention for table creation and switching. This approach might not handle all edge cases automatically, such as data integrity checks or handling large volumes of data efficiently.\\n\\n### Feasibility Analysis\\n\\n- **Advantages**: The changefeed approach leverages TiDB's native capabilities for data replication, ensuring that no changes are lost during the transition. It can be a viable solution for simple schema changes where downtime is not critical.\\n\\n- **Challenges**: This method requires significant manual effort and expertise to ensure data consistency and integrity. It lacks the automation and robustness of tools like gh-ost and pt-osc, which are specifically designed for such tasks.\\n\\n- **Best Practices**: Ensure thorough testing in a staging environment before applying changes in production. Implement comprehensive monitoring to detect any issues during the transition.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nThe changefeed-based workaround can be feasible for certain scenarios, especially when native TiDB features are preferred, and the schema changes are straightforward. However, for complex schema changes or when minimizing downtime is critical, using specialized tools like gh-ost or pt-osc is recommended due to their automation and reliability.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on TiDB changefeeds and their capabilities, you can refer to the official documentation: [TiDB Changefeed Overview](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/changefeed-overview).\\n\\nBy considering these factors, you can make an informed decision on the best approach for your specific use case.\", 'reasoning': None, 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': \"To effectively evaluate the feasibility of using changefeed for unsupported alter operations in TiDB, specifically changing a clustered primary key, we need comprehensive information on TiDB's changefeed features, solutions, and limitations.

Here are some potential causes and solutions:\\n\\n1. **Session Metadata Caching**: TiDB uses session-level metadata caching to improve performance. This means that changes to the database schema, such as creating a new database, might not be immediately visible in other sessions if they are using cached metadata. To address this, you can try the following:\\n   - **Flush Metadata Cache**: Ensure that the metadata cache is refreshed. This can be done by restarting the session or using commands that force a metadata refresh.\\n   - **Check Session Variables**: Verify if there are any session variables related to metadata caching that might be affecting visibility. Adjust these settings if necessary.\\n\\n2. **Version-Specific Bugs**: There might be known issues in specific TiDB versions that affect metadata visibility. It's important to check the release notes and known issues for your TiDB version to see if this is a documented problem.\\n   - **Upgrade or Patch**: If a bug affecting metadata visibility is identified in your version, consider upgrading to a newer version where the issue is resolved. For example, TiDB 8.1.1 and 8.2.0 release notes mention various bug fixes that might be relevant ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/release-8.1.1), [source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/release-8.2.0)).\\n\\n3. **Configuration Adjustments**: Ensure that your TiDB configuration is set up correctly to handle metadata changes efficiently.\\n   - **System Variables**: Review and adjust system variables that control metadata behavior. For instance, the `tidb_enable_metadata_lock` variable can influence how metadata changes are handled during transactions ([source](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/metadata-lock)).\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can help ensure that new databases are immediately visible across different TiDB sessions.

This is crucial for managing concurrent DDL and DML operations effectively. You can check the current settings and adjust them as necessary to ensure that metadata locks are functioning as intended.\\n\\n### 2. **Adjust Caching Settings**\\n   - Review and modify the `tidb_table_cache_lease` variable to optimize write latency. In scenarios where you experience high write latency due to cached tables, consider increasing the lease duration to allow for more efficient caching, especially in read-heavy applications. This can help mitigate issues related to stale reads and improve overall performance.\\n\\n### 3. **Implement Controlled Concurrent Operations**\\n   - When performing DDL operations, limit the number of concurrent DML operations on the same tables. This can help reduce contention and the likelihood of encountering issues related to uncommitted transactions blocking DDL operations. You can gradually increase the concurrency level while monitoring for any visibility issues.\\n\\n### 4. **Monitor and Analyze Performance Metrics**\\n   - Utilize the TiDB Dashboard to continuously monitor key performance metrics, such as average query latency and CPU utilization. Pay close attention to any spikes in latency during concurrent operations, particularly when executing DDL commands alongside DML operations. This monitoring can help identify patterns that may indicate underlying issues.\\n\\n### 5. **Log Detailed Error Information**\\n   - Enable detailed logging for TiDB to capture any errors or warnings related to metadata locks and caching. Analyze these logs to identify specific conditions that lead to visibility issues. Look for error codes or messages that indicate problems with metadata locks or stale reads, which can provide insights into the root causes of the issues.\\n\\n### 6. **Consult Documentation for Known Issues**\\n   - Regularly review the latest release notes and documentation for TiDB, focusing on changes related to metadata locks and caching mechanisms. This can provide insights into known issues and fixes that may be relevant to your testing. For example, the [TiDB 6.5.10 Release Notes](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-6.5.10) and [TiDB 7.5.3 Release Notes](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-7.5.3) contain important information regarding bug fixes related to metadata locks.\\n\\n### 7. **Test with Different Configurations**\\n   - Experiment with different configurations of the caching mechanisms and metadata locks to find the optimal settings for your specific workload. This may involve testing various combinations of caching strategies and lock settings to determine which configuration yields the best performance and visibility.\\n\\n### 8. **Report Findings to the Development Team**\\n   - If you identify a reproducible visibility issue, document your findings and the steps taken to reproduce the issue. This information can be valuable for the TiDB development team to address potential bugs or improve the system's handling of metadata and caching.\\n\\nBy implementing these solutions, you can effectively mitigate metadata visibility issues in TiDB, leading to improved performance and consistency in your database operations.\", 'reasoning': None, 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': \"The goal involves resolving metadata visibility issues in a TiDB cluster where databases aren't visible across sessions unless a session creates a database itself.

It has horizontal scale out or scale in, high availability at financial-grade, real-time HTAP, and cloud important features such as a native distributed database, compatibility with the MySQL 5.7 protocol, and the MySQL ecosystem. The three key components of the TiDB are PD cluster, TiDB cluster, and TiKV cluster. Among them, the PD cluster is the control center of the entire TiDB. It is responsible for generating global TSO timestamps, scheduling the distribution of region in TiKV nodes, collecting the health and load balancing status of TiKV nodes, and assigning transaction ID to distributed transaction. PD itself is also composed of at least 3 nodes and has high availability capabilities, so it is recommended to deploy an odd number of PD nodes. The TiDB server cluster does not store business data, but it is responsible for receiving the SQL statements from the client, parsing and compiling the SQL statements, and finally generating the execution plan. Finally, TiDB server is responsible for executing these execution plans, accessing data in TiKV or TiFlash storage engines, and organizing the result set and return it to the client. Finally, the recovery (GC) of DDL operations and old version data is also done by TiDB server. The TiDB layer itself is stateless. In practice, multiple TiDB instances can be started to provide a uniform access address to the outside world through load balancing components (such as LVS, HAProxy or F5), and client connections can be evenly distributed across multiple TiDB instances to achieve load balancing effects. The data is mainly stored in the TiKV cluster in the form of key-value. The TiKV cluster is mainly responsible for data persistence, MVCC (multi-version concurrency control), Coprocessor (pushing the operator down to the underlying storage node), high availability and strong consistency of transaction and their own replication implementation (using the multi Raft mechanism), which we will cover in detail in the TiKV chapters. Here, we also have another component, TiFlash, a columnar storage engine. It mainly synchronizes data with TiKV through the Raft consensus algorithm, which realizes load balancing and strong consistent read, and TiFlash supports real-time replication.

This is consistent with the limits of the `BIGINT` data type, which is commonly used for `AUTO_INCREMENT` columns.\\n\\n2. **Behavior on Exceeding Maximum Values**:\\n   - If an attempt is made to set the `AUTO_INCREMENT` value to a number greater than the maximum allowed value, it will result in an error. This behavior is similar to MySQL, where exceeding the maximum value for an `AUTO_INCREMENT` column also leads to an error.\\n\\n3. **Incorrect Allocation**:\\n   - There are known issues where `AUTO_INCREMENT` can incorrectly allocate values that exceed the maximum limits without reporting an error. This is a specific behavior in TiDB that can lead to unexpected results, particularly when the `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute is used in conjunction with certain data types. This issue has been documented in the release notes, indicating that it is a recognized limitation of the system.\\n\\n### Comparison with MySQL\\n\\n- **Compatibility**: TiDB aims to be compatible with MySQL, and many of the behaviors regarding `AUTO_INCREMENT` are designed to mirror those of MySQL. However, there are differences in how these features are implemented in a distributed environment.\\n  \\n- **Centralized ID Allocation**: Starting from TiDB v6.4.0, a centralized auto-increment ID allocating service was introduced, which changes how IDs are generated compared to MySQL's approach. In MySQL, IDs are typically generated in a single instance, while TiDB's distributed nature can lead to gaps in the sequence due to multiple servers obtaining IDs from their caches.\\n\\n- **Handling of Non-Consecutive IDs**: In TiDB, the `AUTO_INCREMENT` values are guaranteed to be monotonic (always increasing) on a per-server basis, but they are not guaranteed to be consecutive across multiple servers. This can lead to scenarios where the sequence appears to jump, especially after server restarts or when multiple servers are involved in ID allocation.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nIn summary, TiDB has a maximum value limit for `AUTO_INCREMENT` columns that aligns with the `BIGINT` data type limits. However, it also has unique behaviors and potential issues that differ from MySQL, particularly in a distributed environment. Users should be aware of these constraints and the implications for their database design and operations.\\n\\nFor further details, you can refer to the following sources:\\n- [TiDB AUTO_INCREMENT Documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/auto-increment)\\n- [TiDB Release Notes on AUTO_INCREMENT Issues](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/auto-increment)\", 'reasoning': None, 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': 'To determine if there is a maximum value limit for auto_increment in TiDB, we will follow a structured approach: 1.

This report provides a detailed guide on these topics, offering recommendations and insights to ensure optimal performance, reliability, and scalability.\\n\\n## Deployment Methods\\n\\n### TiUP Deployment\\n\\n**TiUP** is a command-line tool designed to simplify the deployment and management of TiDB clusters. It automates many tasks, such as scaling and configuration changes, through a well-defined topology file. This file describes the cluster's configuration and can be modified for scaling operations. TiUP is ideal for users who prefer direct control over their deployment process.\\n\\n- **Deployment and Scaling**: TiUP allows for easy scaling by adding or removing nodes without interrupting services. [Learn more about scaling TiDB clusters using TiUP](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/scale-tidb-using-tiup).\\n- **Configuration Management**: Regular updates and configuration management are facilitated by TiUP, allowing for performance optimization without downtime. [See how to modify configurations with TiUP](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/maintain-tidb-using-tiup).\\n- **Monitoring and Maintenance**: TiUP can automatically set up monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana. Regular checks using the `display` command ensure all components function correctly. [Explore more about deploying monitoring tools with TiUP](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/production-deployment-using-tiup).\\n\\n### Kubernetes/TiDB Operator Deployment\\n\\n**Kubernetes/TiDB Operator** provides a more automated approach to managing TiDB clusters, leveraging Kubernetes' capabilities for resource management and scalability. It is suitable for environments that require dynamic resource allocation and high availability.\\n\\n- **Deployment and Configuration**: TiDB Operator automates deployment, upgrades, scaling, and configuration changes using Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).

Understand the syntax and structure: A TiUP topology file is a YAML file used to define the configuration and structure of a TiDB cluster. This file is essential for deploying, scaling, and modifying TiDB clusters using TiUP. Here is an overview of its syntax and structure:\\n\\n### Syntax\\n- **YAML Format**: The topology file uses YAML syntax, which is indentation-sensitive. Ensure correct indentation to avoid errors.\\n- **Sections**: The file is divided into several sections, each specifying different aspects of the cluster configuration.\\n\\n### Structure\\n1. **Global Section**: This section contains global configuration settings that apply to the entire cluster.\\n   - `user`: Specifies the user to start the deployed cluster. Default is \"tidb\".\\n   - `group`: The user group for the cluster user. Defaults to the same as `user`.\\n   - `ssh_port`: The SSH port for connecting to target machines. Default is \"22\".\\n   - `deploy_dir`: The directory for deploying components. Can be an absolute or relative path.\\n   - `data_dir`: The directory for storing data. Default is \"data\".\\n   - `log_dir`: The directory for storing logs. Default is \"log\".\\n   - `os`: The operating system of the target machine. Default is \"linux\".\\n   - `arch`: The CPU architecture of the target machine. Supported values are \"amd64\" and \"arm64\".\\n\\n2. **Component Sections**: Each component of the TiDB cluster has its own section, specifying the configuration for that component.\\n   - **PD Servers**: Configuration for PD instances, specifying the machines for deployment.\\n   - **TiDB Servers**: Configuration for TiDB instances.\\n   - **TiKV Servers**: Configuration for TiKV instances.\\n   - **TiFlash Servers**: Configuration for TiFlash instances.\\n   - **TiProxy Servers**: Configuration for TiProxy instances.\\n   - **Monitoring Servers**: Configuration for Prometheus and other monitoring tools.\\n   - **Grafana Servers**: Configuration for Grafana instances.\\n   - **Alertmanager Servers**: Configuration for Alertmanager instances.\\n\\n3. **Server Configs**: This section allows for component-specific configurations, overriding global settings if necessary.\\n\\n4. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Sections for configuring monitoring and alerting tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager.\\n\\n### Example\\nA simple example of a topology file might look like this:\\n\\n```yaml\\nglobal:\\n  user: \"tidb\"\\n  ssh_port: 22\\n  deploy_dir: \"/home/tidb/deploy\"\\n  data_dir: \"/home/tidb/data\"\\n  log_dir: \"/home/tidb/log\"\\n  os: \"linux\"\\n  arch: \"amd64\"\\n\\npd_servers:\\n  - host: 192.168.1.1\\n  - host: 192.168.1.2\\n\\ntidb_servers:\\n  - host: 192.168.1.3\\n\\ntikv_servers:\\n  - host: 192.168.1.4\\n  - host: 192.168.1.5\\n\\nmonitoring_servers:\\n  - host: 192.168.1.6\\n\\ngrafana_servers:\\n  - host: 192.168.1.7\\n```\\n\\nFor more detailed examples and templates, you can refer to the [TiUP documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/tiup-cluster-topology-reference) and the [sample topology file](https://github.com/pingcap/tiup/blob/master/embed/examples/cluster/topology.example.yaml)..\\n2. Define and use internal variables: To define and use internal variables in a TiUP topology file, you can utilize the `global` section of the topology configuration. This section allows you to set default values and configurations that apply to the entire TiDB cluster deployment. Here’s how you can define and use these internal variables:\\n\\n1. **Define Global Variables**: In the `global` section of your topology file, you can specify default settings for various parameters such as `deploy_dir`, `data_dir`, `log_dir`, `os`, and `arch`. These settings will be applied to all components unless overridden at the instance level.\\n\\n2. **Usage of Global Variables**:\\n   - **Deployment Directory (`deploy_dir`)**: This specifies where each component will be deployed. If not set at the instance level, the default is a relative path based on the component name and port.\\n   - **Data Directory (`data_dir`)**: This defines where the data for each component will be stored. If not specified at the instance level, it defaults to the global setting.\\n   - **Log Directory (`log_dir`)**: This indicates where logs will be stored. Similar to the data directory, it defaults to the global setting unless specified otherwise.\\n   - **Operating System (`os`)**: This sets the default operating system for the target machines. The default is \"linux\".\\n   - **Architecture (`arch`)**: This specifies the CPU architecture, with supported values being \"amd64\" and \"arm64\". The default is \"amd64\".\\n\\n3. **Example Configuration**:\\n   ```yaml\\n   global:\\n     user: \"tidb\"\\n     deploy_dir: \"/data/tidb/deploy\"\\n     data_dir: \"/data/tidb/data\"\\n     log_dir: \"/data/tidb/log\"\\n     os: \"linux\"\\n     arch: \"amd64\"\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Overriding Global Variables**: If you need to override a global setting for a specific instance, you can do so by specifying the parameter directly within the instance configuration. This allows for flexibility in managing different configurations for different components or instances.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on configuring the TiUP topology file, you can refer to the official documentation: [Topology Configuration File for TiDB Deployment Using TiUP](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/tiup-cluster-topology-reference)..\\n3. Example in YAML format: TiUP is a tool used for deploying and managing TiDB clusters. When defining a topology file in YAML format for TiUP, you can use internal variables to make the configuration more flexible and easier to manage. Internal variables allow you to define values that can be reused throughout the file, reducing repetition and making updates easier.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of how you might define and use internal variables in a TiUP topology file:\\n\\n```yaml\\n# Define internal variables at the top of the file\\nglobal:\\n  user: \"tidb\"\\n  ssh_port: 22\\n  deploy_dir: \"/tidb-deploy\"\\n  data_dir: \"/tidb-data\"\\n\\n# Define the TiDB cluster topology\\ntidb_servers:\\n  - host: 192.168.1.1\\n    ssh_port: ${global.ssh_port}\\n    deploy_dir: ${global.deploy_dir}/tidb-4000\\n    log_dir: ${global.deploy_dir}/tidb-4000/log\\n\\n  - host: 192.168.1.2\\n    ssh_port: ${global.ssh_port}\\n    deploy_dir: ${global.deploy_dir}/tidb-4000\\n    log_dir: ${global.deploy_dir}/tidb-4000/log\\n\\ntikv_servers:\\n  - host: 192.168.1.3\\n    ssh_port: ${global.ssh_port}\\n    deploy_dir: ${global.deploy_dir}/tikv-20160\\n    data_dir: ${global.data_dir}/tikv-20160\\n\\n  - host: 192.168.1.4\\n    ssh_port: ${global.ssh_port}\\n    deploy_dir: ${global.deploy_dir}/tikv-20160\\n    data_dir: ${global.data_dir}/tikv-20160\\n\\npd_servers:\\n  - host: 192.168.1.5\\n    ssh_port: ${global.ssh_port}\\n    deploy_dir: ${global.deploy_dir}/pd-2379\\n    data_dir: ${global.data_dir}/pd-2379\\n\\nmonitoring_servers:\\n  - host: 192.168.1.6\\n    ssh_port: ${global.ssh_port}\\n    deploy_dir: ${global.deploy_dir}/monitor-9100\\n\\ngrafana_servers:\\n  - host: 192.168.1.7\\n    ssh_port: ${global.ssh_port}\\n    deploy_dir: ${global.deploy_dir}/grafana-3000\\n\\nalertmanager_servers:\\n  - host: 192.168.1.8\\n    ssh_port: ${global.ssh_port}\\n    deploy_dir: ${global.deploy_dir}/alertmanager-9093\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\n\\n1. **Global Variables**: At the top of the file, we define a `global` section where we specify common settings such as `user`, `ssh_port`, `deploy_dir`, and `data_dir`. These variables can be referenced throughout the file using the `${}` syntax.\\n\\n2. **Reusing Variables**: In the `tidb_servers`, `tikv_servers`, `pd_servers`, `monitoring_servers`, `grafana_servers`, and `alertmanager_servers` sections, we use the defined variables to set the `ssh_port`, `deploy_dir`, and `data_dir` for each component. This makes the configuration more concise and easier to update.\\n\\n3. **Flexibility**: If you need to change the deployment directory or SSH port for the entire cluster, you only need to update the `global` section, and all references will automatically use the new values.\\n\\nThis approach helps maintain consistency and reduces the risk of errors when managing large configurations..', 'reasoning': None, 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': 'To define internal variables in a TiUP topology file, we will follow these steps: 1.

If necessary, scale out TiKV Pods before proceeding.\\n   - Identify the `store-id` of the TiKV Pod:\\n   ```shell\\n   kubectl get -n ${namespace} tc ${cluster_name} -ojson | jq \".status.tikv.stores | .[] | select ( .podName == \\\\\"${pod_name}\\\\\" ) | .id\"\\n   ```\\n   - Use the `pd-ctl` command in any of the PD Pods to take the TiKV Pod offline:\\n   ```shell\\n   kubectl exec -n ${namespace} ${cluster_name}-pd-0 -- /pd-ctl store delete ${store_id}\\n   ```\\n   - Wait for the store status (`state_name`) to become `Tombstone`:\\n   ```shell\\n   kubectl exec -n ${namespace} ${cluster_name}-pd-0 -- watch /pd-ctl store ${store_id}\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Unbind the TiKV Pod from the Current Storage**:\\n   - Check the `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) used by the Pod:\\n   ```shell\\n   kubectl -n ${namespace} get pvc -l tidb.pingcap.com/pod-name=${pod_name}\\n   ```\\n   - Delete the `PersistentVolumeClaim`:\\n   ```shell\\n   kubectl delete -n ${namespace} pvc ${pvc_name} --wait=false\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Delete the Old TiKV Pod**:\\n   - Delete the TiKV Pod and wait for a new TiKV Pod to join the cluster:\\n   ```shell\\n   kubectl delete -n ${namespace} pod ${pod_name}\\n   ```\\n   - Verify that the new TiKV Pod is in the `Up` state:\\n   ```shell\\n   kubectl get -n ${namespace} tc ${cluster_name} -ojson | jq \".status.tikv.stores | .[] | select ( .podName == \\\\\"${pod_name}\\\\\" )\"\\n   ```\\n\\n5. **Remove the Useless Evict-Leader Scheduler**:\\n   - Remove the evict-leader-scheduler to clean up:\\n   ```shell\\n   kubectl exec -n ${namespace} ${cluster_name}-pd-0 -- /pd-ctl scheduler remove evict-leader-scheduler-${store_id}\\n   ```\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the official documentation on maintaining Kubernetes nodes that hold the TiDB cluster: [Maintain Kubernetes Nodes that Hold the TiDB Cluster](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/v1.6/maintain-a-kubernetes-node).. After draining, verify the node has been successfully drained using these steps: To verify that a TiKV node has been successfully drained, you can follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Check the Status of the TiKV Node**: Use the `tiup` tool to check the status of the TiKV node. This can be done by running the following command:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   tiup cluster display <cluster-name>\\n   ```\\n\\n   Look for the specific TiKV node in the output and ensure that its status is marked as \"Tombstone\" or \"Offline,\" indicating that it has been successfully drained.\\n\\n2. **Verify Data Consistency**: After draining a TiKV node, it\\'s important to ensure that the data is consistent across the remaining nodes. You can use the `ADMIN CHECK` SQL command to verify the consistency of data and indexes in the affected tables. For example:\\n\\n   ```sql\\n   ADMIN CHECK TABLE table_name;\\n   ```\\n\\n   If there are any inconsistencies, you may need to fix them by following the appropriate procedures, such as renaming and recreating indexes.\\n\\n3. **Remove the Drained Node**: If the node is no longer needed, you can remove it from the cluster. For nodes deployed using TiUP, use the following command:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   tiup cluster scale-in <cluster-name> -N <host> --force\\n   ```\\n\\n   For nodes deployed using TiDB Operator, delete the `PersistentVolumeClaim` and the TiKV Pod:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   kubectl delete -n ${namespace} pvc ${pvc_name} --wait=false\\n   kubectl delete -n ${namespace} pod ${pod_name}\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Clean Up Tombstone Nodes**: If the node is marked as \"Tombstone,\" you can clean it up using the following command:\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   tiup cluster prune <cluster-name>\\n   ```\\n\\nThese steps will help ensure that the TiKV node has been successfully drained and that the cluster remains in a healthy state.

This stops services, cleans data files, and updates the cluster topology.\\n   ```shell\\n   tiup cluster prune <cluster-name>\\n   ```\\n\\nThese steps ensure the TiKV node is properly drained and removed from the cluster without data loss. For more detailed instructions, refer to the official documentation: [Scale a TiDB Cluster Using TiUP](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/scale-tidb-using-tiup).\\n\\n**Why `tiup cluster stop` Does Not Drain the Node**: The `tiup cluster stop <cluster> -N <tidb_node>` command stops the services on the specified node but does not handle the transfer of data and leadership roles to other nodes.

Colder colors indicate lower traffic, while hotter colors indicate higher traffic.\\n   - **Region Compression**: Due to the large number of Regions, they are compressed into 1,500 consecutive ranges called Buckets for display purposes.\\n\\nFor more detailed information, you can refer to the [TiDB documentation on the Key Visualizer](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/dashboard-key-visualizer).\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can effectively monitor and analyze the traffic and performance of your TiDB cluster using the Key Visualizer tool..\\n2. Restart Key Visualizer using the following steps: To restart the Key Visualizer in TiDB, you need to re-enable the TiDB Dashboard, as Key Visualizer is a feature within the Dashboard. Here are the steps to do so:\\n\\n1. **Disable TiDB Dashboard** (if not already disabled):\\n   - Use the `tiup ctl:v<CLUSTER_VERSION> pd` command to disable the TiDB Dashboard on all PD instances. Replace `127.0.0.1:2379` with the IP and port of any PD instance:\\n     ```bash\\n     tiup ctl:v<CLUSTER_VERSION> pd -u http://127.0.0.1:2379 config set dashboard-address none\\n     ```\\n   - After disabling, any attempt to access the TiDB Dashboard will result in an error message indicating that the Dashboard is disabled.\\n\\n2. **Re-enable TiDB Dashboard**:\\n   - Use the `tiup ctl:v<CLUSTER_VERSION> pd` command to request PD to renegotiate an instance to run the TiDB Dashboard. Again, replace `127.0.0.1:2379` with the IP and port of any PD instance:\\n     ```bash\\n     tiup ctl:v<CLUSTER_VERSION> pd -u http://127.0.0.1:2379 config set dashboard-address auto\\n     ```\\n   - After executing the command, you can use the `tiup cluster display` command to view the TiDB Dashboard instance address automatically negotiated by PD. Replace `CLUSTER_NAME` with your cluster name:\\n     ```bash\\n     tiup cluster display CLUSTER_NAME --dashboard\\n     ```\\n\\n3. **Verify the Dashboard**:\\n   - Once re-enabled, you can access the TiDB Dashboard through the negotiated instance address to ensure that Key Visualizer and other features are operational.\\n\\n> **Warning**: If the newly enabled TiDB Dashboard instance is different from the previous one, local data stored in the previous instance, such as Key Visualizer history, will be lost.\\n\\nFor more detailed instructions, you can refer to the official documentation: [Deploy TiDB Dashboard](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/dashboard-ops-deploy)..\\n3. Verify the restart with these steps: To verify that the Key Visualizer has been successfully restarted in TiDB, you can follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Access the Key Visualizer Page**: \\n   - Log in to the TiDB Dashboard and click on **Key Visualizer** in the left navigation menu. Alternatively, you can visit the URL `http://<PD-instance-address>:<port>/dashboard/#/keyviz` in your browser, replacing `<PD-instance-address>` and `<port>` with the actual address and port of your PD instance. For more details, you can refer to the [TiDB documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/dashboard-key-visualizer).\\n\\n2. **Enable the Key Visualizer Feature**:\\n   - If you are using the Key Visualizer for the first time, ensure that the feature is enabled. Go to the **Settings** page by clicking the **Settings** icon in the upper right corner of the Key Visualizer page. Enable data collection and save the settings. This will allow the heatmap to start displaying data.\\n\\n3. **Check the Heatmap**:\\n   - Once the feature is enabled, observe the heatmap on the Key Visualizer page. The heatmap should display traffic data over time, indicating that data collection is active. If the heatmap is visible and updating, it confirms that the Key Visualizer is functioning correctly.\\n\\n4. **Verify Data Collection**:\\n   - Ensure that the data collection is ongoing by checking the toolbar and observing the heatmap for real-time updates. You can adjust the time range or region range to see if the heatmap refreshes accordingly.\\n\\n5. **Use the Refresh Function**:\\n   - Click the **Refresh** button to update the heatmap with the latest data. If the heatmap refreshes and displays current traffic information, it indicates that the Key Visualizer is working as expected.\\n\\nFor more detailed instructions on using the Key Visualizer, you can refer to the [TiDB documentation](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.4/dashboard-key-visualizer)..', 'reasoning': None, 'plan': [{'parameters': {'chain_of_thoughts': 'To restart the Key Visualizer in TiDB, we will follow a structured approach: 1.
