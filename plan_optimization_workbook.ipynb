      "  \"reasoning\": \"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help the user update their plan to diagnose and resolve schema lease errors on a TiDB node using `tidb-ctl`. Let me break down the problem step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the current plan and the user's goal. The goal is to use tools like `tidb-ctl` to diagnose and fix schema lease errors. The current plan has a few steps, but the user's suggestions indicate that it needs to be optimized.\\n\\nLooking at the suggestions, the user wants to add a step to gather specific diagnostic commands using `tidb-ctl`. That makes sense because the original plan didn't include actual commands to run on the node. So, I'll need to add a `calling` instruction to execute `tidb-ctl` commands like `schema lease status` and `schema version`.\\n\\nNext, the vector_search step should be modified to focus specifically on `tidb-ctl` documentation. This way, the information retrieved is more relevant to the tools being used. I'll adjust the query in the vector_search parameters to include terms like \\\"using tidb-ctl for schema lease errors.\\\"\\n\\nAlso, the llm_generate step needs to be enhanced. Instead of just proposing a solution, it should create a step-by-step guide. This means the prompt should ask for a detailed plan, including how to interpret `tidb-ctl` output and potential resolutions. I'll make sure the prompt is clear and in English to maintain consistency.\\n\\nI should ensure that each new step references the correct variables. For example, the `tidb-ctl` output should be stored in a variable that's then used in the llm_generate step. This way, the solution can dynamically adapt based on the actual data collected.\\n\\nI also need to make sure the plan doesn't reference any variables that haven't been defined yet. Since we're starting from the current program counter, which is step 1, I need to insert the new steps after that without disrupting the existing flow.\\n\\nFinally, I'll structure the updated plan in JSON format, making sure all instructions are correctly ordered and that each step logically follows the previous one. The key is to ensure that the plan is both efficient and thorough, addressing all aspects of diagnosing and resolving the schema lease error using the specified tools.\",\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Server Shutdown During DML Execution**:\n",
      "   - **Cause**: If a TiDB server executing a DML statement is stopped by a graceful kill, and the transaction execution time exceeds one DDL lease, an error is reported when the transaction is committed.\n",
      "   - **Solution**: Retry the DML operation once the TiDB server is restarted.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Network Connectivity Issues**:\n",
      "   - **Cause**: The TiDB server might not be able to connect to PD or TiKV during DML execution. This can prevent the server from loading the new schema within one DDL lease (default is 45 seconds), or the server might disconnect from PD due to keep-alive settings.\n",
      "   - **Solution**: Check and ensure stable network connectivity between the TiDB server and PD/TiKV. This involves verifying network configurations and resolving any connectivity issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **High Load or Network Timeout on TiKV**:\n",
      "   - **Cause**: High load on TiKV or network timeouts can lead to schema lease errors.\n",
      "   - **Solution**: Investigate the reasons for high load on TiKV. This can be done by monitoring node loads using Grafana, specifically looking at the TiDB and TiKV metrics. Address any performance bottlenecks or resource constraints identified.\n",

      "  \"reasoning\": \"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to help the user diagnose and resolve schema lease errors on a single TiDB node using tools like `tidb-ctl`. Let me start by understanding the problem.\\n\\nThe user mentioned that they're encountering schema lease errors, which can be caused by various factors like network issues, long-running DML operations, or concurrent DDL operations. They need specific instructions on using `tidb-ctl` or other tools to investigate the issue.\\n\\nLooking at the current plan, it starts with a reasoning step, then uses `vector_search` to gather documentation, followed by `llm_generate` to propose a solution. However, the suggestions indicate that the plan should be optimized to include detailed steps on using `tidb-ctl`.\\n\\nI think the first thing to do is ensure that the plan includes using `tidb-ctl` to gather diagnostic data. So, I should add a step where `tidb-ctl` is called to collect information about the schema lease status. This could involve running commands like `schema lease status` or similar to get detailed insights into the current state of the schema lease.\\n\\nNext, after gathering the necessary data, the plan should analyze this information to identify the root cause. This might involve checking for long-running transactions, network latency between the TiDB node and other components like TiKV or PD, or conflicts arising from concurrent DDL operations.\\n\\nI also need to make sure that the plan provides actionable steps. For example, if the issue is due to a long-running DML operation, the solution might include identifying and terminating such operations. If network issues are at play, the plan should suggest checking network configurations or latency between nodes.\\n\\nAdditionally, the plan should include references to TiDB documentation that specifically address schema lease errors. This could involve using `vector_search` to retrieve relevant sections of the documentation to guide the user through the troubleshooting process.\\n\\nI should also consider including a step where the user is instructed to adjust configuration settings if necessary. For instance, tweaking the lease duration or other parameters related to schema management might help prevent recurring issues.\\n\\nFinally, I need to ensure that the plan is structured in a way that each step logically follows the previous one, guiding the user from diagnosis to resolution. This includes maintaining a clear sequence of instructions, using appropriate variables to store intermediate results, and ensuring that all steps contribute directly to achieving the goal of resolving the schema lease error.\\n\\nIn summary, the updated plan should integrate the use of `tidb-ctl` for gathering specific diagnostic data, include steps to analyze this data, reference relevant TiDB documentation, and provide actionable solutions tailored to the identified causes of the schema lease error.\",\n",

Here’s a comprehensive analysis of potential causes and solutions, along with guidance on using `tidb-ctl` commands to diagnose and resolve these issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Potential Causes of Schema Lease Errors\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Improper Lease Configuration**: The `lease` parameter in TiDB affects the speed of Database Schema Changes (DDL). If set too low, it might lead to frequent schema lease errors, especially in production environments where DDL safety is crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Network Issues**: Communication problems between TiDB and PD (Placement Driver) can prevent TiDB from updating or retrieving version information, leading to schema lease errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cluster Start-Up Delays**: After starting the TiDB cluster, the first DDL operation might take longer due to the election of the DDL leader, which can cause temporary schema lease issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Concurrent DDL Operations**: Executing multiple DDL statements simultaneously can slow down the process, as DDL operations are executed serially in TiDB.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Comprehensive Solution\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 1: Verify and Adjust Lease Configuration\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Check Current Lease Setting**: Ensure that the `lease` parameter is set appropriately. In production, it is recommended to set it to a higher value (e.g., 60 seconds) to ensure DDL safety.\n",
      "- **Adjust Lease Parameter**: If necessary, adjust the lease parameter by restarting the TiDB server with the desired lease value using the command line option `--lease=<value>`.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 2: Diagnose Network Issues\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Check Network Connectivity**: Ensure that there is stable network connectivity between TiDB and PD servers. Use network diagnostic tools to verify the connection.\n",
      "- **Monitor PD Logs**: Check PD logs for any network-related errors that might affect schema operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 3: Use `tidb-ctl` for Diagnosis\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Install `tidb-ctl`**: Ensure that `tidb-ctl` is installed on your system. It is a command-line tool for managing and diagnosing TiDB clusters.\n",
      "- **Check DDL Status**: Use `tidb-ctl` to check the status of DDL operations. The command `tidb-ctl ddl status` can provide insights into the current DDL operations and their states.\n",
      "- **Interpret Outputs**: Look for any anomalies or errors in the output that might indicate issues with schema leases or DDL operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Step 4: Address Concurrent DDL Operations\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Schedule DDL Operations**: Avoid running multiple DDL operations simultaneously. Schedule them during low-traffic periods to minimize impact.\n",
      "- **Monitor DDL Performance**: Use TiDB’s monitoring tools to track the performance of DDL operations and adjust the workload accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Reference\n",
      "\n",
      "For more detailed information on managing TiDB clusters and handling schema lease issues, you can refer to the official TiDB documentation:\n",

This could provide additional context and examples that might be useful for users facing similar issues. Additionally, modify the existing steps to include a more detailed explanation of how to interpret the outputs of `tidb-ctl` commands, possibly by including example outputs and their analysis. This would enhance the user's understanding and ability to diagnose issues effectively.\n",

      "  \"reasoning\": \"Okay, I'm trying to help the user with their schema lease error issue on a single TiDB node. They want to use tools like `tidb-ctl` to diagnose and resolve the problem. \\n\\nFirst, I need to understand what a schema lease error is. From what I remember, schema lease errors occur when TiDB can't acquire a lease for a schema change, which might block DDL operations. Common causes include network issues, long-running transactions, or concurrent DDL operations.\\n\\nThe user's current plan uses `vector_search` to gather documentation and then `llm_generate` to propose solutions. However, the suggestions indicate that the plan should be more detailed, especially in using `tidb-ctl` and interpreting its outputs.\\n\\nI should add steps to gather more detailed information. Maybe include using `tidb-ctl` commands to check the schema lease status and other relevant metrics. This will help the user get specific data about what's happening on their node.\\n\\nAlso, the plan should guide the user on interpreting these results. For example, if `tidb-ctl` shows a long-running transaction, the user needs to know how to identify and terminate it. Including example outputs can make this clearer.\\n\\nI need to ensure that the plan doesn't just list commands but also explains each step and what the user should look for. This will make the troubleshooting process more effective.\\n\\nLastly, I should structure the plan so that each step logically leads to the next, ensuring the user can follow through without getting lost. This includes maintaining the correct sequence of instructions and referencing the necessary variables properly.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the updated plan should include detailed diagnostic steps using `tidb-ctl`, analysis of potential causes, and clear instructions for resolving each issue. This way, the user can systematically troubleshoot and fix the schema lease error.\",\n",

This guide provides a comprehensive approach to diagnosing and resolving these errors using `tidb-ctl` commands and other troubleshooting techniques.\\n\\n#### Step 1: Verify Current Lease Configuration\\n\\n**Command**: `tidb-ctl lease`\\n\\n- **Purpose**: To check the current lease duration setting on the TiDB node.\\n- **Example Output**:\\n  ```\\n  Lease: 45s\\n  ```\\n- **Interpretation**: The lease duration is set to 45 seconds. This setting impacts how quickly schema changes propagate across the cluster. Ensure this value is appropriate for your environment—typically longer in production for safety.\\n\\n#### Step 2: List and Monitor DDL Jobs\\n\\n**Command**: `tidb-ctl ddl jobs`\\n\\n- **Purpose**: To list ongoing and completed DDL jobs, helping identify any long-running or stuck operations.\\n- **Example Output**:\\n  ```\\n  Job ID: 12345\\n  Type: Add Index\\n  State: Running\\n  Schema State: Write Only\\n  ```\\n- **Interpretation**: A running DDL job is shown. If a job is stuck, it may indicate a schema lease issue. Investigate further if jobs remain in a non-final state for too long.\\n\\n#### Step 3: Identify the Current DDL Owner\\n\\n**Command**: `tidb-ctl ddl owner`\\n\\n- **Purpose**: To determine which TiDB node is the current DDL owner, responsible for executing schema changes.\\n- **Example Output**:\\n  ```\\n  DDL Owner: tidb-server-1\\n  ```\\n- **Interpretation**: `tidb-server-1` is the DDL owner. If schema lease issues persist, check this node's logs and status for potential problems.\\n\\n#### Step 4: Review DDL History\\n\\n**Command**: `tidb-ctl ddl history`\\n\\n- **Purpose**: To view a history of completed DDL jobs, useful for spotting patterns or recurring issues.\\n- **Example Output**:\\n  ```\\n  Job ID: 12344\\n  Type: Create Table\\n  State: Finished\\n  Duration: 30s\\n  ```\\n- **Interpretation**: A completed DDL job with its duration is shown.

       "  'final_answer': 'Schema lease errors in TiDB can arise due to several factors, primarily related to the configuration and operation of the TiDB server. Here’s a comprehensive analysis of potential causes and solutions, along with guidance on using `tidb-ctl` commands to diagnose and resolve these issues.\\n\\n### Potential Causes of Schema Lease Errors\\n\\n1. **Improper Lease Configuration**: The `lease` parameter in TiDB affects the speed of Database Schema Changes (DDL). If set too low, it might lead to frequent schema lease errors, especially in production environments where DDL safety is crucial.\\n\\n2. **Network Issues**: Communication problems between TiDB and PD (Placement Driver) can prevent TiDB from updating or retrieving version information, leading to schema lease errors.\\n\\n3. **Cluster Start-Up Delays**: After starting the TiDB cluster, the first DDL operation might take longer due to the election of the DDL leader, which can cause temporary schema lease issues.\\n\\n4. **Concurrent DDL Operations**: Executing multiple DDL statements simultaneously can slow down the process, as DDL operations are executed serially in TiDB.\\n\\n### Comprehensive Solution\\n\\n#### Step 1: Verify and Adjust Lease Configuration\\n\\n- **Check Current Lease Setting**: Ensure that the `lease` parameter is set appropriately. In production, it is recommended to set it to a higher value (e.g., 60 seconds) to ensure DDL safety.\\n- **Adjust Lease Parameter**: If necessary, adjust the lease parameter by restarting the TiDB server with the desired lease value using the command line option `--lease=<value>`.\\n\\n#### Step 2: Diagnose Network Issues\\n\\n- **Check Network Connectivity**: Ensure that there is stable network connectivity between TiDB and PD servers. Use network diagnostic tools to verify the connection.\\n- **Monitor PD Logs**: Check PD logs for any network-related errors that might affect schema operations.\\n\\n#### Step 3: Use `tidb-ctl` for Diagnosis\\n\\n- **Install `tidb-ctl`**: Ensure that `tidb-ctl` is installed on your system. It is a command-line tool for managing and diagnosing TiDB clusters.\\n- **Check DDL Status**: Use `tidb-ctl` to check the status of DDL operations. The command `tidb-ctl ddl status` can provide insights into the current DDL operations and their states.\\n- **Interpret Outputs**: Look for any anomalies or errors in the output that might indicate issues with schema leases or DDL operations.\\n\\n#### Step 4: Address Concurrent DDL Operations\\n\\n- **Schedule DDL Operations**: Avoid running multiple DDL operations simultaneously. Schedule them during low-traffic periods to minimize impact.\\n- **Monitor DDL Performance**: Use TiDB’s monitoring tools to track the performance of DDL operations and adjust the workload accordingly.\\n\\n### Reference\\n\\nFor more detailed information on managing TiDB clusters and handling schema lease issues, you can refer to the official TiDB documentation:\\n\\n- [TiDB Cluster Management FAQs](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.5/manage-cluster-faq)\\n\\nBy following these steps and utilizing the `tidb-ctl` tool, you can effectively diagnose and resolve schema lease errors in TiDB, ensuring smooth and efficient database operations.'},\n",

       "  'final_answer': \"Schema lease errors in TiDB can arise from several potential causes, often related to the management and synchronization of schema versions across different nodes in a distributed database environment. Here are some potential causes and a comprehensive solution to address these issues:\\n\\n### Potential Causes of Schema Lease Errors\\n\\n1. **Version Mismatch**: Schema lease errors can occur when different nodes in the TiDB cluster have inconsistent schema versions. This can happen if a node fails to update its schema version due to network issues or if the schema change is not propagated correctly.\\n\\n2. **Network Latency**: High network latency can delay the propagation of schema changes across the cluster, leading to temporary inconsistencies and schema lease errors.\\n\\n3. **Configuration Issues**: Incorrect configuration of the schema lease duration can lead to errors. If the lease duration is too short, nodes may not have enough time to update their schema versions before the lease expires.\\n\\n4. **High Concurrency**: In scenarios with high concurrency, multiple schema changes might be attempted simultaneously, leading to conflicts and errors if not managed properly.\\n\\n### Comprehensive Solution\\n\\n1. **Ensure Consistent Schema Versioning**: Implement robust mechanisms to ensure that schema changes are consistently propagated across all nodes. This can include using a centralized schema management service that tracks and coordinates schema changes.\\n\\n2. **Optimize Network Configuration**: Reduce network latency by optimizing the network configuration and ensuring that all nodes are well-connected. This can involve upgrading network infrastructure or optimizing routing paths.\\n\\n3. **Adjust Schema Lease Duration**: Review and adjust the schema lease duration configuration to ensure it is appropriate for the cluster's size and network conditions. A longer lease duration can provide more time for nodes to update their schema versions.\\n\\n4. **Implement Conflict Resolution Mechanisms**: Develop mechanisms to handle conflicts that arise from concurrent schema changes. This can include using locking mechanisms or implementing a queue system to serialize schema changes.\\n\\n5. **Monitor and Alert**: Set up monitoring and alerting systems to detect schema lease errors promptly. This can help in quickly identifying and resolving issues before they impact the database's operation.\\n\\n6. **Regular Testing and Validation**: Conduct regular testing and validation of schema changes in a staging environment before applying them to the production environment. This can help identify potential issues early.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on specific schema lease issues and solutions, you can refer to the TiDB documentation available at [TiDB 3.0.0-rc.3 Release Notes](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.1/release-3.0.0-rc.3) and [TiDB 2.1.16 Release Notes](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.5/release-2.1.16).\"},\n",

Here are the primary causes and their corresponding solutions:\\n\\n1. **Server Shutdown During DML Execution**:\\n   - **Cause**: If a TiDB server executing a DML statement is stopped by a graceful kill, and the transaction execution time exceeds one DDL lease, an error is reported when the transaction is committed.\\n   - **Solution**: Retry the DML operation once the TiDB server is restarted.\\n\\n2. **Network Connectivity Issues**:\\n   - **Cause**: The TiDB server might not be able to connect to PD or TiKV during DML execution. This can prevent the server from loading the new schema within one DDL lease (default is 45 seconds), or the server might disconnect from PD due to keep-alive settings.\\n   - **Solution**: Check and ensure stable network connectivity between the TiDB server and PD/TiKV. This involves verifying network configurations and resolving any connectivity issues.\\n\\n3. **High Load or Network Timeout on TiKV**:\\n   - **Cause**: High load on TiKV or network timeouts can lead to schema lease errors.\\n   - **Solution**: Investigate the reasons for high load on TiKV. This can be done by monitoring node loads using Grafana, specifically looking at the TiDB and TiKV metrics. Address any performance bottlenecks or resource constraints identified.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on these issues and solutions, you can refer to the following sources:\\n- [TiDB Troubleshooting Map for v7.1](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v7.1/tidb-troubleshooting-map)\\n- [TiDB Troubleshooting Map for v6.5](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.5/tidb-troubleshooting-map)\\n- [TiDB Troubleshooting Map for v6.1](https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v6.1/tidb-troubleshooting-map)\\n\\nThese resources provide comprehensive guidance on troubleshooting schema lease errors and other related issues in TiDB.'}]"
